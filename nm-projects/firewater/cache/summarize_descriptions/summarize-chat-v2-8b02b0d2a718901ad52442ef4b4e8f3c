{"result": "\"DEVI\" and \"URMILA\" share a familial connection, with Urmila being a part of Devi's nightly ritual. Devi embraces Urmila in a memory recalled by Tara, indicating a past connection between the characters. Urmila fears the acid-tongued guru, but also shows a protective and supportive attitude towards Devi by insisting on accompanying her for training, including to Ahalya. There seems to be a dynamic between the two characters, as Urmila gives Devi both a reproving and disbelieving look at different instances.
