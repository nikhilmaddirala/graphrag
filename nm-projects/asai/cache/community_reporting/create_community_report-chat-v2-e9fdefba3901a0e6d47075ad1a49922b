These models can provide immediate responses but struggle with slow, considered responses. They are being scaled to potentially solve intelligence problems but have edge cases and points of failure when scaled for business impact. LLMs are described as having fundamental problems related to hallucination and system two thinking, but they also produce better responses through reasoning and thinking out loud. They primarily engage in system one thinking, with challenges in incorporating system two thinking. LLMs tend to hallucinate responses when faced with questions about domain-specific or up-to-date information. Despite their limitations in producing good essay outputs, LLMs have made AI more accessible to the average person, enabling them to start using AI to solve problems and create solutions. Piyush uses LLMs for tasks such as generating summaries, revising emails, and providing analysis in a specific format. These models assist in grouping data and documents together using strategies such as semantic chunking and agentic chunking. Overall, LLMs are a type of AI model with specific types of failure, challenges in scaling and reliability, and a tendency to generalize rather than memorize data points.
