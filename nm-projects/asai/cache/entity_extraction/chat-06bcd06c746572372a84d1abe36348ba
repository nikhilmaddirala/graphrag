Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

And imagine you have to go pick up your mom at the airport. And I've often had to do this. If I have to pick up someone at the airport, I have to first go through my messages. Often it's on WhatsApp or somewhere, and I have to scroll a while to see where did they send me the info about their flight.\n\nAnd then I take that info, I copy it into like Google and look for like the flight status. And then I see the time. And then maybe I perform some other action after that. Like I open maps to navigate, or maybe I call an Uber or something like that. So it's kind of automating.\n\nPiyush (18:10)\nYeah.\n\nYeah, no, that resonates with me. Yeah, that's same thing.
