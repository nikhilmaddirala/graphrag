Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Like what?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (1:04:12)\nYeah.\n\nOkay, so let's think about if you're an app developer, you have some popular app on the app store right now, the main decision that you're faced with now is should I integrate with Apple Intelligence or not? That's the main thing you have to decide right now. And I think it will be really interesting to see the decisions that various app developers are making in this regard, because so far, most apps have been providing their own AI solutions within the product.\n\nAnd they've been trying to like upsell that as an add -on. Often it's like, you have to pay a few dollars extra to get this AI. So, you know, there's like Notion AI, there's Adobe Acrobat AI, there's AI in so many apps. And what they're saying is that, look, we will make this app like AI enhanced for you and you pay us a little extra. I think that's probably going away now because, I mean, well, whether or not it's going away depends.\n\nPiyush (1:05:19)\nReally? Well, I mean, yeah, I see what you mean. I mean, it'll stay for some like for Adobe, for example, it's such a nuanced thing. It'll maybe stay because like editing images or videos with AI, you might.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (1:\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
