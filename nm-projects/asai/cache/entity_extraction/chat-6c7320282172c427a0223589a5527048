Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

So what you're saying is that there's what I'm looking at right now are three layers.

What you're saying is even the\n\nNikhil (30:59)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Company. Yeah. Yeah, I...\n\nPiyush (31:21)\ncompute layer or so the GPU layer has a value chain within that. So like this GPU is already an abstraction over a GPU value chain. Like each presumably then each one of these layers have their own value chain. And for AI, we have an abstraction on top of these abstractions.\n\nNikhil (31:41)\nYeah, I mean it's always a question of how deep you want to go. Ultimately if you go deep enough into any value chain you will get to like some raw materials and extracting that. So yeah I think you have to decide what level of abstraction is relevant here.\n\nPiyush (31:50)\nRight, right.\n\nI have a question. What is the difference between what we're looking at right now that we're calling a value chain versus an architecture? Like this also looks like the architecture for AI, right?
