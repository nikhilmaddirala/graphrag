Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Yeah, I've had some strands to reflect on this since you shared it with me, essentially help me understand if I'm thinking about this correctly. What you're trying to do is you're trying to enrich the prompt itself with the most useful context. And all this business of like vector databases and all this is to enrich that prompt, right? It's so that within the prompt itself, the LLM has all the necessary information required to answer that question.\n\nAnd then you're also limiting the prompt to like make sure that the LLM only answers from this context. So you're trying to limit the hallucination. Am I thinking about?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (34:47)\nYes, 100%. That is exactly correct. That's exactly what's happening. So if we walk through this chart here, it starts with an original question the user has, which is something about a private document.
