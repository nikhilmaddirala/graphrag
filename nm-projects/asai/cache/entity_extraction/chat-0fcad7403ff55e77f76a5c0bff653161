Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Of course, that program kind of failed and what took off instead was the machine learning approach, but it's something I've always been curious about. And then I think when I went to business school later, I started taking some coursework in computer science and machine learning. And that led to me doing another master's program in computer science. And I have been really fascinated with AI specifically.\n\nthroughout my whole educational journey. Also professionally, I work as an AI product manager. Currently I'm at Meta, prior to that I was at Adobe. At both of these places I've built and scaled AI products that are serving billions of users and millions of businesses. And prior to that I started my career as a consultant with Deloitte where I was also advising Fortune 500 companies on...\n\nthings like AI strategy and implementation. Although at that time we didn't call it AI, we called it something like analytics strategy or big data strategy. But essentially what we were doing was the early days of AI strategy.
