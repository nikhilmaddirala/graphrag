There's a meme that Elon Musk shared. I want to share this actually with you. I don't know if you've seen this, perhaps you have already seen this, but I love internet memes and I love so hard when I saw this meme. So it just, it was like one of the funniest memes I've ever seen. But I think like Elon Musk is saying that he's going to stop a ban Apple devices.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (01:23)\nOkay.\n\nWait, before you do that, let's describe this for people who are listening to it. So, all right, let me try. So there's a picture of a couple and one person is drinking from a coconut. On the coconut it says iPhone and the person, the woman, it says Apple and supposedly Apple is trying to drink from the iPhone. And then there's a guy who has a straw into her mouth and it's drinking.\n\nPiyush (01:43)\nI don't even know how to describe\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
