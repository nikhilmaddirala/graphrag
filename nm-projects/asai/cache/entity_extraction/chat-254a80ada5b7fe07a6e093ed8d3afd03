Identify all entities.

I mean, I don't know if you would call it a foundation model, but these are large language models essentially. And they have two flavors of these. There are some models that can run on device. That means they're small enough that can fit on your phone. It has enough memory and processing power to run those models. Yeah.\n\nPiyush (31:47)\nSomething like a Gemini Nano, right?
