But I mean, I don't know how much sense it makes. Tesla employees are probably already using OpenAI and Chad GPT. Sure, so this is a legitimate concern, but I think it's based on a misunderstanding that by default Apple is going to do this. And as we just saw, that's the third step and the last resort. Let's think about like.\n\nhow often this may happen. We don't have any data, but if I were to guess, I would use this 80 -20 rule. And I'd say first, you figure out can it be handled on device or not. Maybe 80 % of the requests are handled on device and 20 % are sent off device. And then out of the off device requests, probably 80 % of those can be handled by Apple's private cloud. Only 20 % of those are sent to OpenAI. So 20 % times 20%, that's like four.\n\nPiyush (43:57)\nwriting.\n\nYeah. I mean, let's play the devil's advocate here on the 80 -20. I completely agree with you. One could also make an argument that the types of requests that you'd be most worried about not sharing are maybe the more complicated ones that would largely be representative of the ones that go to a third party model. Right? I don't know.
