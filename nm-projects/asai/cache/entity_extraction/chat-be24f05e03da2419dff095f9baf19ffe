Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

So if you're...\n\ncompany focuses on developing really good applications, then you probably don't want to be spending your time and energy on figuring out how to manage the hardware and the infrastructure for that. And if you can outsource that, you would try to do that. So I think these are all various forces that like propelled the cloud transformation. And so I think the last thing we didn't touch upon was also like the development side of it.\n\nSo if I want to develop an application and I want you to be able to use that application that I developed, I need to be able to host that. So first I have to develop the application and then I have to deploy it somewhere, deploying or host it somewhere so that you can use it. And...\n\nFor hosting applications, typically people used to have to have their own servers. So I would buy, so suppose I develop an app, I don't know what it does.
