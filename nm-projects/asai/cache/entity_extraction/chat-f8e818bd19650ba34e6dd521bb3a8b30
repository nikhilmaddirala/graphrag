Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

First, it was from a non tech world to a tech world. And now it's from a tech world to an AI powered tech world. So I really think in 10 years or how long did it take Mark Andreessen or this?\n\nPiyush (16:21)\nHmm.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (16:42)\n15 years ago. So definitely, I think 15 years from now, it's highly likely that we'll look back and think it's really silly that people thought AI would not affect their life or their business in some way.\n\nPiyush (16:56)\nThat's a very insightful perspective. Yeah. I think that Uber example that you gave, that's a remarkable example. You're right. Who would have in their right mind thought, like, imagine if you're like a New York taxi cab driver, like, did you ever think that you would be disrupted by tech? No, right? But these things happen. So I imagine in a similar fashion.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (17:10)\nNo, yeah. Same travel industry, there's Airbnb, how tech companies are disrupting travel for so many products and services today. And if you see any company today or any industry where technology is not a major component, that is ripe for disruption. And you have a good entrepreneurship opportunity right there.
