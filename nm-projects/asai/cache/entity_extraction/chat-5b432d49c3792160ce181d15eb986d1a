So yeah, I think that that's the interesting thing to think about in the application layer.\n\nPiyush (57:20)\nMm -hmm.\n\nThat's not settled yet though. That's to be seen. Like this thing is evolving in front of us as we speak. And it's to be seen who ends up extracting the value here. Will it be the NVIDIAs, the hyperscalers or the, I don't know, apples with the application, right? Because...\n\nNikhil (57:29)\nAhem.\n\nAnd to be clear, they're not all in direct competition with each other. Maybe like in some indirect sense, there's a competition. The ones that are like neighboring each other are the ones that are like more in direct competition. So think about applications are kind of coming into competition now with like the platform layer as the platforms start to build in their own AI. And by platforms, I mean like Mac and Windows and iOS and Android and things like that. So.\n\nPiyush (57:57)\nThat makes sense.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah. And then I was reading somewhere that NVIDIA is now so valuable that in order to keep up with their growth, which has been insane, they'll have to maybe start competing with the hyperscalers and offer their own cloud services. That could be one way to go about it.\n\nNikhil (58:26)\nI think they're trying to do that because\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
