Again, I don't know if most people realize, but Meta makes almost entirety of its revenue from advertising. The problem with the changes that Apple made is...\n\nMeta was losing the ability to do tracking and measurement of these ads properly. So it was losing a lot of signal. So Mark Zuckerberg decided, in the industry it's called signal loss. So Mark Zuckerberg decided to hire the best AI people in the world to figure out how do we work in the world of signal loss.
