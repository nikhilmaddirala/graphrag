Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

But these days there are many cloud -based solutions where you can run the program on like Google's cloud or Microsoft's cloud and it's in many ways easier than setting it up on your own computer. That way actually it's true automation. It can even run when you're not on your computer. And this is a personal preference but I'm going to demonstrate a platform.\n\ncalled Google Colab today which is a very simple platform where you can run simple snippets of Python code. This is good for just developing and brainstorming your initial ideas and getting it working and then once you have that set up then you have to find a place to host your application if you want to actually like run it in an automated way. So let's let me open my screen and let's just walk through a little bit of what\n\nPiyush (35:29)\nAre we doing a live demo?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (35:30)\nNot like a live demo, I coded this up like before the call, so I'm just gonna walk through it. Maybe if there's interest in future, we can do a live demo of like how to actually code something like this. But so you just have to go to this website.\n\nPiyush (35:36)\nCool.\n\nIs this all free to set up if someone wants to replicate this? Would this be freely available to them?\n\nNikh\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
