Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The quality of the prompt really matters because we talked about this last time, LLMs can only do the system one thinking which is just like immediately giving you a response. They don't give you like a slow considered response.\n\nwhich is what we try to accomplish with prompting. Actually, Andrew Ng, who's a really famous AI educator, and also now he is investing in some startups, he had a famous quote recently about the limitations of just using a general purpose AI. He's like, it's like asking a student to write an essay, but you tell them that they have to sit at the keyboard.\n\nand continuously type without ever pressing the backspace key or without ever pausing and then end at the end of that. And that's the output you're getting. So that's the analogy he's making. And I think that's, yeah. So just imagine if you had to write an essay, it requires you to maybe write a few lines and then you think about it and you pause and then you write some more and then you restructure your thoughts. You delete something you wrote and at the end, maybe you just got a first draft and then you take a day to think about it.\n\nYou come back to it the next day and then you have some more thoughts and you revise it and that's how you come up with like a good essay.
