Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

I know we talked about it earlier this week.\n\nand you explained your workflow to me, like a simplified version of it is that you get a new book of clients, so you work in sales and you get new clients, and your goal or your process, I mean, your ultimate goal is that you want to convert these new accounts into customers of yours, that's your ultimate goal, but the way in which you get there is first you do some research about the companies for you to understand the companies better and in a general sense,\n\nand then you try to get some unique insights about the company that are relevant to your situation, like about what their online search presence looked like and things like that. And then you use the output of this research to inform conversations that you're gonna have with your client so that you can be more informed and provide value to them so that they're more likely to like you and wanna work with you.\n\nPiyush (28:32)\nYeah, that's beautifully summarized.
