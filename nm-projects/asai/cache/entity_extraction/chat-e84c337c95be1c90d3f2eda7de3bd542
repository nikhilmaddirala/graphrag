Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

However, this layer should have been another protocol where other companies should have been built. And the reason they call it fat, I may not be explaining it in the best way possible, but the idea is very similar to what you were talking about is Google and Facebook. What they ended up doing is they accrued all the value to themselves. Hence the name fat protocol. Cause like,\n\nNikhil Maddirala (26:03)\nHmm\n\nHmm.\n\nPiyush (26:21)\nNo one makes money on TCP IP. It's just a free protocol for everyone to use. That's what maybe search should have been, is that Google should just have been a protocol that other people use, and the value should have been accrued to those other businesses. But what Google and Facebook ended up doing is accruing all the value to themselves, and hence the name FAT Protocol. So to your point that it's not a new thing, and everyone's been trying to do it. So I guess that makes sense. So anyways, I don't want to digress. I don't want to talk about this value chain business\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
