Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

And then when I give it a new input, it should apply that pattern to that input. But my goal is not for it to have memorized those individual data points because that's not useful for me. So similarly,\n\nPiyush (26:14)\nAnd that's also one cool thing about human intelligence is what we do, right? It's just we like observe these patterns and we try and generalize our learnings from that and we apply it to new situations. Make sense?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (26:26)\nYep, absolutely. But I think the, we have higher level concepts of understanding when we are grounded in facts versus when we're not. Although even that is a hard skill often.\n\nPiyush (26:40)\nDude, I hallucinate sometimes. Like I've often had situations where I will say something that I believe to be factually correct.
