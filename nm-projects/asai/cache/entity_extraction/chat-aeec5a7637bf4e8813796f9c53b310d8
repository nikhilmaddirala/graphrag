Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

So I am curious, like what are these edge cases in the context of LLMs?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (13:22)\nFor sure. So before we get into that, I think there are like a couple of different things going on why building LLM based applications is hard. One is the thing we just talked about, like self -driving, the last 10 % problem is really hard to solve and figuring out how to get those edge cases. That's one thing. A second reason, which I think we won't get to in this episode, but we should talk about in a future episode is platform and ecosystem challenges. This is a significant...\n\nbottleneck for LLM applications to really be successful because right now we're still in the old iPhone era and our access to the digital world is controlled by Apple and Google who control the operating systems for iOS and Android and there are certain things that they will let applications do and certain things that they prevent applications from doing. And so for example, I would love to be able to...\n\nPiyush (14:13)\nHmm.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (14:17)\nreplace Siri with chat GPT or some other assistant on my iPhone but that's fundamentally not possible and not because of failure and maybe some of it is but there's even if they solve that\n\nPiyush (14:21)\nRight.\n\nIt's just that that application won't have access\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
