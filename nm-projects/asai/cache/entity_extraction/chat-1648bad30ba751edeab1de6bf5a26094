Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Meaning, could I add a bunch of names in a spreadsheet and execute a custom GPT on all the rows? You know what I mean? So like a spreadsheet with 20 rows with 20 different company names and basically the custom GPT takes the spreadsheet as an input.\n\nNikhil Maddirala (52:03)\nThis would be extremely easy to do via the API. I'm not sure if you can do that via UI. I don't think you can. Actually, I was hoping that in this episode, we could also get into advanced use cases of what you can do with the API versus the UI. But I think since we're almost at the end of the hour, let's just wrap this up. And that can be a good topic for next time or for a future episode.
