Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

But I feel like the benefit that I get out of these services are so much more than the $60 a month that they charge. So I've been very happy with all of these LLM, but I'm very curious. You mentioned AI. Am I right in assuming that you mean these LLM chatbots when you mention AI, or does AI come in other forms as well?\n\nNikhil Maddirala (03:40)\nRight, so I think when we're talking about someone who doesn't know how to use AI or is a beginner, the first entry point is going to be the AI chatbots that are based on LLMs, because we had AI even before that. It was always there in big tech companies and apps you use, you know, when...\n\nPiyush (03:42)\nyou\n\nNikhil Maddirala (04:02)\nYou open up Spotify or Netflix and they're recommending content to you when you open Meta and they're recommending ads to you.
