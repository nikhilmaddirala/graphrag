00:00:00:00 - 00:00:24:29
Nikhil Maddirala
one common AI task is spam filtering. So you get a bunch of emails and you're the goal of this task is to classify emails into spam or not spam. Okay. And you can take two approaches to this. One is the rule based approach. And one is the machine learning approach. In the rule based approach, what you're trying to do is handcraft specific rules that the program will follow to determine whether an email is spam or not.

00:00:24:29 - 00:00:34:18
Nikhil Maddirala
So in classical programing, which is the rule based approach, what you do is you create a program, you feed in the rules and the data and you get the answers out of it.

00:00:34:23 - 00:00:44:27
Nikhil Maddirala
The answer in this case being like spam or not spam, right? Okay. But in machine learning, what happens is you feed the data and the answers into the,

00:00:44:27 - 00:00:49:02
Nikhil Maddirala
machine learning program. And as the output, you get the rules. So

00:00:49:02 - 00:01:06:26
Speaker 1
Hey, welcome to the art and science of AI journeys. In the season one, which we recorded in May 2023 as a continuous three hour long conversation. And season two is now live. So if you're enjoying this discussion, please subscribe for new episodes every week.

00:01:07:05 - 00:01:08:05
Nikhil Maddirala
so do you want to get started?

00:01:08:05 - 00:01:08:27
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Let's do it.

00:01:09:02 - 00:01:30:25
Nikhil Maddirala
So I think the first thing I want to talk about is what is artificial intelligence? And like one definition I looked up is that basically it refers to computer systems that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. So like any time a computer program can do something that you think requires human intelligence, that's what we call AI.

00:01:31:01 - 00:01:33:23
Nikhil Maddirala
And it's a pretty vague definition.

00:01:33:23 - 00:01:57:21
Nikhil Maddirala
calculator AI like initially? Probably yes. You would call a calculator AI. Before we had calculators, people would have considered that to be AI. But the moment like that becomes easy to do, that's no longer considered AI. So it's kind of always like a moving target. Every time something becomes easy for computers to do, people start thinking, that's no longer AI, that's just normal.

00:01:57:21 - 00:02:04:07
Nikhil Maddirala
Like computer program. Like even if you think about like, computer games, basic computer games that we have when you interact with,

00:02:04:07 - 00:02:18:14
Nikhil Maddirala
computer opponents, like maybe there's a car racing game and there's a computer that's racing a car that is, I like the computer is driving the car on on the game. But today, like, we don't really think of that as, as AI because.

00:02:18:14 - 00:02:30:12
Piyush Agarwal
So you're trying to say that AI has been here for a while. It's just that it's like in our general consciousness, the word AI is like been increasingly popular recently. But, like in some sense AI has been around like all of these things, right?

00:02:30:13 - 00:02:40:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes. And if you go far enough back, you can think of any kind of technology as in some sense, I like before we had calculators, we probably had,

00:02:40:06 - 00:02:49:01
Nikhil Maddirala
you know, like an abacus and, you know, the old, like, thing that you move beads on, like that's a rudimentary form of AI. So is this a matter of advancement?

00:02:49:01 - 00:02:57:11
Nikhil Maddirala
And I think it's always a moving target. AI is always referring to the next big thing that computers can't do right now. Right.

00:02:57:11 - 00:03:05:27
Nikhil Maddirala
so anyway, we're right now going through like a revolution where AI programs are doing more and more than ever before.

00:03:05:27 - 00:03:06:19
Nikhil Maddirala
but I think,

00:03:06:19 - 00:03:10:15
Nikhil Maddirala
it's helpful to break down the different like approaches to.

00:03:10:17 - 00:03:11:05
Nikhil Maddirala
So

00:03:11:05 - 00:03:15:13
Nikhil Maddirala
when before we think about machine learning and what machine learning is,

00:03:15:13 - 00:03:19:28
Nikhil Maddirala
let's just think about two broad approaches to how I can be approached.

00:03:20:00 - 00:03:21:07
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. I mean,

00:03:21:07 - 00:03:23:26
Piyush Agarwal
what is machine learning in relation to AI, first of all?

00:03:24:02 - 00:03:33:11
Nikhil Maddirala
So machine learning is a particular approach to AI. That's basically it. Like AI refers to doing any tasks that require human intelligence.

00:03:33:11 - 00:03:35:19
Piyush Agarwal
And machine learning is one of the ways to take.

00:03:35:19 - 00:03:43:11
Nikhil Maddirala
As one particular approach. And in fact, I there's a nice graphic that I found that explains this, which is AI is this big thing.

00:03:43:11 - 00:03:55:14
Nikhil Maddirala
there are two broad approaches to AI. There's what's called rule based systems, and then there's what's called machine learning. And we can go into the differences between the two and within machine learning, a subset of that is neural networks.

00:03:55:14 - 00:03:57:12
Nikhil Maddirala
And deep learning is another subset.

00:03:57:12 - 00:04:04:20
Piyush Agarwal
Of you have heard all of these terms that I use like okay, these are some things about AI, but okay. Yeah. These are all approaches to.

00:04:04:20 - 00:04:14:12
Nikhil Maddirala
These are approaches. And you can see the relation here of which is a subset of which one and which is mutually exclusive. And everything that today is really popular. ChatGPT

00:04:14:12 - 00:04:20:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Midjourney, what you were talking about, most modern applications are within this little deep learning,

00:04:20:06 - 00:04:23:12
Nikhil Maddirala
circle over here. So that's the approach that's become most part.

00:04:23:12 - 00:04:34:04
Piyush Agarwal
So are you saying like if like, this is the stuff where I've been super fascinated and to understand this and to fully appreciate it, it's like the approach I should take is to understand how we came to this.

00:04:34:07 - 00:04:38:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if like, that's the approach you should take if you want to understand,

00:04:38:20 - 00:04:40:15
Nikhil Maddirala
the general foundations. Yes. Yeah.

00:04:40:17 - 00:04:42:01
Piyush Agarwal
That's what I would. Yeah I like that. Okay.

00:04:42:01 - 00:04:45:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. I mean you there are also other approaches to this, like the,

00:04:45:23 - 00:04:53:27
Nikhil Maddirala
for example, one of my favorite AI educators, his name is Jeremy Howard. He has a course you can take online is called Fast AI.

00:04:53:27 - 00:05:00:17
Nikhil Maddirala
and he has the opposite approach. He's like, forget about he has a course that starts with deep learning. He says, forget about understanding all this stuff.

00:05:00:23 - 00:05:11:09
Nikhil Maddirala
It's called practical deep learning for coders. And he just gives you some high level Python libraries that you can use to start building deep learning applications right off the bat. So that's one approach.

00:05:11:09 - 00:05:17:05
Nikhil Maddirala
I think if you want to go and build something that's a better approach, if you want to understand things like it's useful to have some theory.

00:05:17:09 - 00:05:17:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:05:17:17 - 00:05:32:25
Nikhil Maddirala
so one thing, before getting into machine learning, it's useful to think about this distinction. In the early days of AI, like until about the 1980s or so, the rule based system was the most popular approach to AI. And,

00:05:32:25 - 00:05:38:13
Nikhil Maddirala
to understand the difference between these two approaches, we can consider a simple example of an AI task.

00:05:38:15 - 00:06:05:22
Nikhil Maddirala
think about spam filtering. So one common AI task is spam filtering. So you get a bunch of emails and you're the goal of this task is to classify emails into spam or not spam. Okay. And you can take two approaches to this. One is the rule based approach. And one is the machine learning approach. In the rule based approach, what you're trying to do is handcraft specific rules that the program will follow to determine whether an email is spam or not.

00:06:05:22 - 00:06:09:08
Nikhil Maddirala
And you might have rules that, hey, if it has the.

00:06:09:09 - 00:06:13:19
Piyush Agarwal
If it doesn't have a subject. Yes. yeah, but I understand what you're trying to

00:06:13:19 - 00:06:16:04
Piyush Agarwal
say. Like something. Yeah. Then it's a spam.

00:06:16:04 - 00:06:26:10
Nikhil Maddirala
It's basically a series of like if then clauses. It's a logical structure. You can say if it has the word lottery winner in it, if it has the word Nigerian prince.

00:06:26:13 - 00:06:26:19
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah.

00:06:26:24 - 00:06:31:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. Yeah. Classify that as bad. Yeah. Otherwise it's not spam. Yeah.

00:06:31:01 - 00:06:54:12
Nikhil Maddirala
so that basically the original approach to I was building increasingly complex rule based systems to do these kind of tasks. So going back to the computer gaming example that we talked about, like if you want to drive in a racetrack, you can program explicit instructions and say, like if you are, you know, check all these conditions if you're this much distance away from the wall, if you're this much distance away from the racer, then accelerate.

00:06:54:13 - 00:07:13:27
Nikhil Maddirala
Otherwise break. But giving very explicit rules. That is the rule based system, right? Whereas the machine learning approach is something completely different. That's where you say that I'm not going to define the rules. I'm going to let the program discover the rules based on a bunch of data that I'm feeding it, and we'll talk about how that works.

00:07:13:27 - 00:07:21:09
Nikhil Maddirala
But at a high level, that's the distinction between these two approaches. And the rule based system is what I spend a lot of time, studying.

00:07:21:09 - 00:07:36:20
Nikhil Maddirala
when I studied logic, right. The original approach was that we could get smarter and smarter AI systems by making smarter and smarter rules and understanding the world better. But it turned out that approach kind of hit a dead end, and it didn't have that much power.

00:07:36:20 - 00:07:39:04
Nikhil Maddirala
And the machine learning approach is really what,

00:07:39:04 - 00:07:41:15
Nikhil Maddirala
gave AI systems a lot more power, right?

00:07:41:15 - 00:07:58:05
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, yeah, I remember I was watching like back when, I mean, it's not that AI has been popular in all of our general consciousness. Only very recently. It's been like 5 or 6 years. Yeah. And I took my first attempt, like maybe five, six years ago. And there was a very nice explainer video by like one of the Google associated channels.

00:07:58:07 - 00:08:14:29
Piyush Agarwal
And they were trying to explain exactly this is like, how does machine learning really work? And the example they took was, imagine if you had to create a program that identifies oranges. Okay. There are two approaches you can take. One approach is a rule based approach where you say, if the color of the thing that you're seeing is orange.

00:08:14:29 - 00:08:33:02
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. And if it's round and if the texture is like the a little grainy, then it's an orange. But hey, imagine what happens if someone submits a photo of a black and white orange. Yeah. Like we as humans would be able to identify and say it's an orange. Yeah, but your program has just failed because it doesn't meet your first rule that it should be orange in color.

00:08:33:05 - 00:08:44:21
Piyush Agarwal
And that's a problem with rule based approaches. Like you will always find some area where like one of your rules fails, but like we as humans don't have those like, like rigid rules.

00:08:44:21 - 00:08:44:28
Piyush Agarwal
yeah.

00:08:45:00 - 00:08:57:15
Nikhil Maddirala
So the world is just too complex. Like even in the spam example, the original approaches were like they would filter out keywords. Correct? And then you say that, okay, like million dollar lottery is filtered out. But what if I'm just genuinely right, you know.

00:08:57:18 - 00:09:00:16
Piyush Agarwal
Imagine missing out on $1 million because like or.

00:09:00:18 - 00:09:12:23
Nikhil Maddirala
It could just be that I'm making a joke. I'm like, oh, hey, I read this article about $1 million lottery. It could be any number of things. But yeah, it's too complex to like model. And these systems have always failed, right.

00:09:12:23 - 00:09:17:29
Piyush Agarwal
As the complexity increases. yeah. Rule based models hit a plateau. So it's.

00:09:18:02 - 00:09:18:09
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay.

00:09:18:09 - 00:09:19:16
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:09:19:18 - 00:09:24:02
Nikhil Maddirala
So one good way to think about what is the difference between,

00:09:24:02 - 00:09:44:14
Nikhil Maddirala
machine learning and rule based systems. Is this diagram actually which I really like it. I saw it in one of my machine learning classes at university, and it really helped me understand what is machine learning. So in classical programing, which is the rule based approach, what you do is you create a program, you feed in the rules and the data and you get the answers out of it.

00:09:44:19 - 00:09:54:23
Nikhil Maddirala
The answer in this case being like spam or not spam, right? Okay. But in machine learning, what happens is you feed the data and the answers into the,

00:09:54:23 - 00:10:10:26
Nikhil Maddirala
machine learning program. And as the output, you get the rules. So that's like the key difference between these two approaches. In one case, you are explicitly providing the rules, in the other case you're providing the answers and you're getting the rules as an output of that.

00:10:11:03 - 00:10:11:16
Piyush Agarwal
Right.

00:10:11:16 - 00:10:28:02
Nikhil Maddirala
So that I would say is the key difference, where you're saying, I'm not going to try to learn. What are the rules here? What distinguishes spam from not spam? I'm just going to provide a bunch of data and let the system figure out what are the underlying patterns in that data, right?

00:10:28:08 - 00:10:42:11
Piyush Agarwal
And I mean, the ultimate goal in both scenarios is actually to get two answers that because the ultimate goal is to provide an input to the system and be able to determine if, like, like put it under a model and see if you get an answer or not.

00:10:42:14 - 00:10:51:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes. I guess you could make a distinction here between within answers. You can say like known answers and unknown answers. So in machine learning,

00:10:51:01 - 00:11:02:23
Nikhil Maddirala
terminology we call it training data and validation data. So like, you know, training data is like what I train the model on. And then I have to go and test or validated on data that it hasn't seen before.

00:11:02:23 - 00:11:04:13
Nikhil Maddirala
So. Right. You know, I might have,

00:11:04:13 - 00:11:21:16
Nikhil Maddirala
and a set of like maybe 10,000 examples of spam and not spam emails. And that's what I'm calling answers here. But my ultimate goal is to go and use this on emails that have not yet been written, emails that are going to be written tomorrow or next year and apply the same rules to those emails.

00:11:21:20 - 00:11:22:25
Nikhil Maddirala
Right. And yeah.

00:11:22:28 - 00:11:23:17
Piyush Agarwal
That makes sense.

00:11:23:24 - 00:11:25:26
Nikhil Maddirala
That's the that's the ultimate goal.

00:11:25:26 - 00:11:30:19
Nikhil Maddirala
so yeah, I think then we can talk about some of the basic concepts of like, what is,

00:11:30:19 - 00:11:40:07
Nikhil Maddirala
a model to start with? Like because the output of machine, like ultimately with a machine learning system, what you're going to get is like a model that will predict,

00:11:40:07 - 00:11:41:12
Nikhil Maddirala
new answers for you.

00:11:41:12 - 00:11:52:08
Nikhil Maddirala
And the definition of a model is basically it's a representation of a system or process that can be used to make predictions. That's ultimately what you're trying to make predictions about.

00:11:52:12 - 00:12:14:19
Piyush Agarwal
So so if I understand the way you're going through this correctly, so what you said is somewhere in the 1980s, folks realized that the classical programing approach hits a wall. And if you need to make advances in computer science or just in advances in our original pursuit, which is to make our systems more human intelligence. Yeah, then we need to take a different approach.

00:12:14:19 - 00:12:27:17
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. And that approach turned out to be machine learning is exactly. Yeah. So now advances started happening in the machine learning field. So the genesis genesis of this field was somewhere in the 1980s. And so we'll get into that now. Like what are some.

00:12:27:17 - 00:12:52:17
Nikhil Maddirala
And most recent advances. Neural networks and deep learning have seen the most advances in the 2000s in this century. And particularly in the 20 tens. I think because the scale of computational power and data that's needed to make them very useful has only recently emerged and will. Yeah. Before getting into neural networks, let's talk about I'll start with what I would call classical ML.

00:12:52:18 - 00:12:55:04
Nikhil Maddirala
That's like machine learning that works.

00:12:55:04 - 00:12:58:14
Nikhil Maddirala
you know, pre 2000, let's say we didn't need a ton of

00:12:58:14 - 00:13:00:08
Nikhil Maddirala
data and a ton of computational power.

00:13:00:11 - 00:13:06:12
Piyush Agarwal
And you're saying to understand that even the classical ML approach, you have to first understand what training data is. And then I think you're getting into what.

00:13:06:12 - 00:13:08:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. Or like what is a model to start actually.

00:13:08:19 - 00:13:09:09
Piyush Agarwal
So let's start with that.

00:13:09:09 - 00:13:15:29
Nikhil Maddirala
I came up with a list of like what are five components of like what a model is okay. So these are five things.

00:13:15:29 - 00:13:27:16
Nikhil Maddirala
this is a simplified view. They're probably more things. But you need to know what is the model architecture. And you need to know what are the features of the model. And then the model will have parameters.

00:13:27:19 - 00:13:43:17
Nikhil Maddirala
It'll have an objective function. And I'll have a training algorithm I have all these five things. You have a model that you can use to go make predictions about the world and go, you know, predict whether an email is spam or not, spam or whatever task that that you want to do with it.

00:13:43:18 - 00:13:47:07
Piyush Agarwal
You're saying ultimately a model is a prediction making engine?

00:13:47:07 - 00:13:47:24
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes.

00:13:47:25 - 00:13:48:04
Piyush Agarwal
Okay.

00:13:48:06 - 00:13:49:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes, it's a prediction.

00:13:49:10 - 00:13:56:05
Piyush Agarwal
That's a great okay, okay I understand. And then these are the components typically. Yeah that go into building a model. okay.

00:13:56:07 - 00:13:56:23
Nikhil Maddirala
And

00:13:56:23 - 00:14:01:10
Nikhil Maddirala
so I think I wanted to start with a simple example of a model, one of the most simple,

00:14:01:10 - 00:14:03:04
Nikhil Maddirala
machine learning models,

00:14:03:04 - 00:14:07:17
Nikhil Maddirala
is called linear regression. We can start with that and we'll take a.

00:14:07:17 - 00:14:10:01
Piyush Agarwal
Very scary sounding name.

00:14:10:04 - 00:14:10:18
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:14:10:18 - 00:14:12:20
Piyush Agarwal
But can you make it like accessible for me.

00:14:12:20 - 00:14:30:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. So this diagram I think does a pretty good job of making it accessible to you. It's just basically a line. It's a line on an XY plane. That's what regression is. So basically here what you're trying to do is the task here is to predict the price of a home. Okay. Now again that's okay.

00:14:30:01 - 00:14:30:23
Nikhil Maddirala
You're given a home.

00:14:30:23 - 00:14:32:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Predict the price and what do you mean.

00:14:32:06 - 00:14:34:00
Piyush Agarwal
Given a home like I see your.

00:14:34:00 - 00:14:34:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Home?

00:14:34:13 - 00:14:43:16
Nikhil Maddirala
yeah. Usually you would have a data set with a bunch of houses listed on it, but you could think about it as like Zillow, right? How does Zillow work today when you go on Zillow or Redfin.

00:14:43:16 - 00:14:45:05
Piyush Agarwal
If given certain features about you,

00:14:45:05 - 00:14:46:04
Piyush Agarwal
can I predict the price the.

00:14:46:04 - 00:14:53:07
Nikhil Maddirala
Zillow will give you this thing called a Zestimate, right? It tells you what it. Yeah, right. And the Zillow Zestimate is way more complex than what we're going to talk.

00:14:53:07 - 00:15:05:26
Piyush Agarwal
It's also wrong or whatever. It's it's we can get into that. I have a conspiracy theory is that the Zillow estimate actually ruined the real estate market for everyone. Zillow estimate and the Redfin estimate. Okay. Yeah. Anyways. Okay. You don't have.

00:15:05:29 - 00:15:06:21
Nikhil Maddirala
To. We can talk about that.

00:15:06:21 - 00:15:12:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Or maybe we can talk about it after this example. I'm curious why you think that. Yeah. So in this very simplified example,

00:15:12:26 - 00:15:22:11
Nikhil Maddirala
there's only one feature we're using okay, to predict. And this feature is called number of rooms. So just assume it's a very simplified. We say this is one feature I use.

00:15:22:11 - 00:15:34:19
Nikhil Maddirala
And I'm going to predict how much the house cost. It's probably going to be inaccurate. Or maybe in a world in which you restricted it to like, I'm only looking at homes within a certain area where all other things are fixed, you might say.

00:15:34:24 - 00:15:41:04
Piyush Agarwal
No, I agree with you. I think, yeah, like if you had to take like one thing as a predictor of the home price, like one basic thing.

00:15:41:04 - 00:15:43:05
Nikhil Maddirala
To say, yeah, you know, square footage, it's.

00:15:43:05 - 00:15:45:17
Piyush Agarwal
Not going to be right. But it's a, it's a good indicator. Yeah.

00:15:45:19 - 00:15:46:04
Nikhil Maddirala
So,

00:15:46:04 - 00:15:55:21
Nikhil Maddirala
I the only reason I picked this example is to like, explain like what these things mean here. So model architecture that just means like what is this model.

00:15:55:21 - 00:16:04:13
Nikhil Maddirala
it's like the underlying structure of the model. And in this case the model is just this equation that says price equals 100 plus 50 times the number of rooms.

00:16:04:13 - 00:16:09:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. Because that's the line that fits best with the existing data we have. Right?

00:16:09:18 - 00:16:11:29
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. So you're saying you have some existing data.

00:16:11:29 - 00:16:12:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:16:12:19 - 00:16:16:10
Piyush Agarwal
With a bunch of houses with the number of rooms in those houses.

00:16:16:10 - 00:16:17:10
Nikhil Maddirala
These are the data points.

00:16:17:10 - 00:16:18:09
Piyush Agarwal
And the prices of the house.

00:16:18:10 - 00:16:18:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:16:18:18 - 00:16:20:12
Piyush Agarwal
You plotted them on this line.

00:16:20:15 - 00:16:40:02
Nikhil Maddirala
No. You plotted them first and then you tried to find what is the line that best fits those data points. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So that's the we covered the first thing. That's a model architecture okay. Features. As I said here the feature there's only one feature feature is basically the input variables. Or like the attributes right that you consider of individual

00:16:40:02 - 00:16:40:22
Nikhil Maddirala
data points.

00:16:40:22 - 00:16:42:19
Nikhil Maddirala
And here in this simplified example there's.

00:16:42:24 - 00:16:43:16
Piyush Agarwal
Number of rooms.

00:16:43:17 - 00:16:45:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Is number of feature is the feature right. Yeah.

00:16:45:22 - 00:16:51:14
Piyush Agarwal
So go back to your previous slide. So model architecture is in this case linear regression.

00:16:51:16 - 00:16:52:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Linear regression.

00:16:52:15 - 00:16:53:18
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Because it's

00:16:53:18 - 00:16:57:23
Piyush Agarwal
like one line. Yeah. Right. Right. And features is the number of parameters.

00:16:57:27 - 00:16:59:14
Nikhil Maddirala
Known as parameters is different.

00:16:59:14 - 00:16:59:25
Piyush Agarwal
Oh sorry.

00:17:00:00 - 00:17:03:00
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. Features is the input characteristics okay.

00:17:03:01 - 00:17:03:11
Piyush Agarwal
Okay.

00:17:03:14 - 00:17:28:25
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. So next is parameters actually. So this model has two parameters. You can see them here the number 100 and the number 50 are the two parameters of this model okay. So 100 is called the intercept and 50 is called the coefficient of the first feature okay. So in generalized way you will say that the like y equals b plus like beta 1X1 plus beta 2X2.

00:17:28:29 - 00:17:37:14
Nikhil Maddirala
That's the linear regression formula where for every as you add more features you will get more parameters right. Each feature will have its own coefficient.

00:17:37:14 - 00:17:42:18
Piyush Agarwal
So the parameters score deals with the features. Yes.

00:17:42:18 - 00:17:44:19
Piyush Agarwal
is it a 1 to 1 ratio like,

00:17:44:21 - 00:18:02:02
Nikhil Maddirala
in the case of linear regression, yes it is 1 to 1, but no, often it's exponential. And then when we talk about GPT three, remember GPT three has 175 billion parameters. This model has two parameters. So I, I want to build up some of the intuition here.

00:18:02:02 - 00:18:29:01
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Actually I heard this before. GPT for has a trillion parameters. GPT three has 170. So I want to know how do I think like it okay a billion and a trillion is a cool number. Like I understand like oh something big is happening. Yeah. But how do I think about this? Are you saying that every time I'm talking to GPT four versus GPT three, when I, when I asked you for a question and when it answers me, it looks at a trillion things every time.

00:18:29:01 - 00:18:30:17
Nikhil Maddirala
175 billion. Yeah.

00:18:30:19 - 00:18:31:12
Piyush Agarwal
GPT three looks at.

00:18:31:13 - 00:18:36:18
Nikhil Maddirala
Just start with this example first. Every time you interact with this model, you give it a home.

00:18:36:18 - 00:18:46:06
Nikhil Maddirala
by giving it a home, that means you just input the number of rooms, rooms and you ask it for the answer. Right. It's calculating two parameters and giving you the answer. Right. It's saying it's.

00:18:46:06 - 00:18:48:23
Piyush Agarwal
True. But in this case I'm. My input is,

00:18:48:23 - 00:18:54:12
Piyush Agarwal
scaling with the number of features. Right. Like in the case of GPT, the input is a simple prompt.

00:18:54:15 - 00:19:17:21
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh yes. But actually the internally there could be a lot of things. So for example, the features don't have to correspond to the inputs. I could create a feature called the square root of the number of rooms I got. Yeah. And if suppose I have two features like number of rooms and square footage. Using those I could create like many more features, I can say the product of the square footage and number of rooms is another feature, right?

00:19:17:22 - 00:19:35:05
Nikhil Maddirala
The square of the number of rooms times the cube of the square footage. So I could create like, you know, 100 features, which is those two inputs and that would have 100 parameters. So that's. Yeah, often there's a balance, like as you increase the number of parameters you can get more predictive power.

00:19:35:05 - 00:19:37:16
Nikhil Maddirala
but you have to find the optimal number of parameters.

00:19:37:16 - 00:19:45:02
Nikhil Maddirala
Sometimes if you have too many parameters, you might overfit the data. You might just be having too much like computational,

00:19:45:02 - 00:19:46:25
Nikhil Maddirala
expenditure. That's not necessary.

00:19:46:26 - 00:19:49:28
Piyush Agarwal
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I think, but have a good understanding.

00:19:50:01 - 00:20:05:08
Nikhil Maddirala
Keep in mind that this model has two parameters. Yeah, GPT three has 175 billion parameters. Right. And along the way, when we get to neural networks, I'll show you another model that has like about maybe 100,000 parameters. That'll be a good in between. Right?

00:20:05:11 - 00:20:11:21
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. That makes sense. I think it also helps me put in context when I hear stuff like, oh God, four has a trillion. Yeah.

00:20:11:21 - 00:20:30:24
Nikhil Maddirala
So think of parameter as like the number of knobs that can be turned, like what are the different things that the model can tweak in the training process. Because all all that's happening in like model training is it's actually that's the next topic we're going to cover is model training. So we talked about parameters. Now next

00:20:30:24 - 00:20:32:22
Nikhil Maddirala
we've talked about the objective function.

00:20:32:24 - 00:20:52:04
Nikhil Maddirala
The objective function is. So we start with just these data points. There's no line here. We don't know what the line is. Where the line is. Just what we came up with right as a result of training with a given objective function. So in this case objective function is just what you're telling the AI system to optimize for.

00:20:52:07 - 00:20:57:10
Piyush Agarwal
I see what you mean. So one objective, the objective function we're using in this case is the price of the home another object.

00:20:57:14 - 00:21:12:21
Nikhil Maddirala
So this is not the price sorry. Price is the output like that you want the objective function is. Suppose I give you like a line that looks like this okay. And a line that looks like this. How do you evaluate which of those two lines is better at predicting the price?

00:21:12:23 - 00:21:20:10
Piyush Agarwal
Well, I mean the line comes afterwards, right? Next. Yes. You plot houses with the number of rooms and the prices that's.

00:21:20:10 - 00:21:31:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Given to you. You have like you have a data set of ten or let's say you have a data set of thousand homes and you know how many rooms each home has and what the price of each home is. You plotted them on this.

00:21:31:01 - 00:21:38:01
Piyush Agarwal
I'm going to draw a bunch of lines and see where most of the homes fit, like which line most of the homes will fit in. And that will be the line. Yeah.

00:21:38:02 - 00:21:45:21
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. So actually just expand that further. What exactly does that mean? Yeah. You draw a bunch of lines. How do you evaluate if one line is better than the other line?

00:21:45:21 - 00:21:48:24
Piyush Agarwal
The line in which most of the data points,

00:21:48:24 - 00:21:50:26
Piyush Agarwal
will fit in? Like or what do you.

00:21:50:26 - 00:21:53:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Mean by fit in like they'll be exactly on the line or close.

00:21:53:29 - 00:21:54:20
Piyush Agarwal
To lines.

00:21:54:20 - 00:21:56:11
Nikhil Maddirala
okay, what if I have a,

00:21:56:11 - 00:22:07:25
Nikhil Maddirala
you have a line that fit? Say, there are like 2000 data points. You have a line that fits, like, maybe like our. I'm sorry. It's hard to think. Let's think about just ten data.

00:22:07:25 - 00:22:12:03
Piyush Agarwal
If you like this, somehow calculus will get involved here. Like you have to find,

00:22:12:03 - 00:22:15:21
Piyush Agarwal
the closeness of the,

00:22:15:21 - 00:22:21:15
Piyush Agarwal
data points to your line and figure that out for every line. And then finally, it'll be some value which will show you.

00:22:21:15 - 00:22:30:05
Nikhil Maddirala
Actually, that's exactly it. Yeah, yeah. So it's not how many fit on the line because there could be some that are just far away. You're trying to minimize the distance.

00:22:30:09 - 00:22:36:28
Piyush Agarwal
That we should. I said maybe calculus will get involved somewhere. Well yeah. Because yeah. Now I'm going back to my high school days. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

00:22:37:00 - 00:22:37:14
Nikhil Maddirala
So,

00:22:37:14 - 00:22:42:02
Nikhil Maddirala
in this case we use an objective function called mean squared error.

00:22:42:02 - 00:22:57:08
Nikhil Maddirala
basically your error is basically the distance between the actual home price and then the predicted price. Yeah. What's the line that is called the error. So here error could be like $50 here. Actually this area would be -50. This error could be plus 50.

00:22:57:13 - 00:23:07:03
Nikhil Maddirala
That's maybe plus ten. So actually the reason we squared is because if you sum up all the errors, the plus and minuses will cancel themselves out. But that's still a bad line.

00:23:07:03 - 00:23:17:05
Nikhil Maddirala
so what they do is they take a mean squared error. So for each line you compute the objective function is the mean squared error. So you look at all the errors for each individual data point.

00:23:17:05 - 00:23:36:15
Nikhil Maddirala
You take the square of those right. And then you average them out right. That's the objective function. And then that's what you can use to if you draw like a thousand lines to figure out which is the best line. So and then the last step is the training algorithm which is actually generate this line or this model for you.

00:23:36:15 - 00:23:50:25
Nikhil Maddirala
And actually the way you phrased it initially is a pretty good way to think about it, which is randomly generate like a thousand lines and evaluate them on the objective function to choose the best one. But there's a more sophisticated way of doing that.

00:23:50:25 - 00:23:56:01
Nikhil Maddirala
because this process would take like too long if you just generated like thousands of lines.

00:23:56:03 - 00:23:56:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:23:56:13 - 00:24:04:08
Nikhil Maddirala
what, one of the coolest innovations in machine learning is this training algorithm called gradient descent.

00:24:04:08 - 00:24:23:11
Nikhil Maddirala
what it does is first it plots a random line. It just assigns random values to the parameters. And then it looks at the. This is where the calculus comes in. It looks at the slope of that with respect to the objective function, and tries to figure out which direction to go in.

00:24:23:14 - 00:24:27:14
Nikhil Maddirala
so it's like, you know, do I go it instead of generating.

00:24:27:14 - 00:24:51:03
Piyush Agarwal
Oh, I see, I see. Look, let me finish your thought and see if I'm headed in the right direction. Money. Can I do this? If you find it annoying, then we will like. Because I interrupted us and she's okay with it. So what you're saying is, instead of drawing a thousand lines and figuring out the line which most closely aligns with your objective function, yeah, you draw one line and you move that one line in the direction of what will ultimately exact objective.

00:24:51:04 - 00:25:01:22
Nikhil Maddirala
You first draw one line, and then you figure out which direction you like moving, right? And you keep moving it in that you shift the. Here you have only two parameters to play with. So the model is going to play with this.

00:25:01:22 - 00:25:08:14
Nikhil Maddirala
suppose we call it B and A is going to play with BNA, but it knows which direction to move it in to get.

00:25:08:16 - 00:25:11:10
Nikhil Maddirala
to a better objective function value.

00:25:11:10 - 00:25:13:12
Nikhil Maddirala
so yeah, it just keeps doing that until.

00:25:13:13 - 00:25:18:18
Piyush Agarwal
Right, I'm trying to see why this is needed because like right now I have an example of like a very simple model.

00:25:18:19 - 00:25:19:04
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:25:19:04 - 00:25:27:01
Piyush Agarwal
And I'm like, why do you need to go through all that? You just see where the line will be obvious to you, but the line will not be obvious to you when you have a insanely big model.

00:25:27:01 - 00:25:34:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Actually, even the moment when you have like 3 or 4 parameters, it's already too complex. You you can only visualize one.

00:25:34:13 - 00:25:36:26
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, like I don't even know how to visualize two parameters.

00:25:36:26 - 00:25:40:07
Nikhil Maddirala
I mean, sorry if there's two features, that's a plane. It's not a line anymore.

00:25:40:07 - 00:25:54:07
Piyush Agarwal
It's a three. It's a 3D space. And for that I don't. Yeah, yeah, I've seen a lot of videos in like people trying to explain how to think about fourth or fifth dimensions. Yeah. Whenever I see those videos I'm like, yeah, that's cool. But like the next day I forget, like, I don't know, like my mind can't process more than four dimensions, so I, I see what you mean.

00:25:54:09 - 00:26:14:25
Nikhil Maddirala
So and then with machine learning you get into multi million dimensions right. Yeah. Right. So this is just a simpler example to understand the concept. But I think the coolest thing is that we have this algorithm that can tell you how to set your parameters such that you will get to the best objective function value.

00:26:15:02 - 00:26:15:16
Piyush Agarwal
Right.

00:26:15:16 - 00:26:28:14
Nikhil Maddirala
It'll start with something completely random, right. And it'll automatically adjust itself until it gets to the optimal value. So that's the cool thing about machine learning. So yeah, I mean we could go into the detail. Do you have a greater understanding.

00:26:28:14 - 00:26:29:12
Piyush Agarwal
Of what you mean by more.

00:26:29:12 - 00:26:33:06
Nikhil Maddirala
It's pretty tangential. Yeah. So I that's pretty much.

00:26:33:06 - 00:26:34:20
Piyush Agarwal
Like what.

00:26:34:22 - 00:26:43:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Classical machine learning is like. And there are many different types of like regression is one there are different tasks. You can do.

00:26:43:01 - 00:26:56:19
Nikhil Maddirala
regression is like trying to predict the price. Classification is another popular task. Classification is like I have two classes and I'm trying to predict like orange and not orange or like spam and not spam, but is the same general idea.

00:26:56:19 - 00:27:00:13
Piyush Agarwal
So that one's classification and this one's regression. Regression where yeah,

00:27:00:13 - 00:27:04:12
Piyush Agarwal
it's not a yes and no, but it's an like it's a value that you're trying to predict.

00:27:04:14 - 00:27:13:27
Nikhil Maddirala
The classification has discrete outcomes. It regression has continuous outcomes. Right. So it's like yeah, this is continuous. any real number right between 1 and 2. Right.

00:27:13:28 - 00:27:23:01
Piyush Agarwal
So but the ultimate objective of a model is to predict something. Yes. Either the knowledge of the thing that is being predicted. Yeah. You have different you.

00:27:23:01 - 00:27:24:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Have different types of model. And the.

00:27:24:22 - 00:27:26:14
Piyush Agarwal
Popular ones are regression.

00:27:26:14 - 00:27:27:18
Nikhil Maddirala
Models and class of.

00:27:27:18 - 00:27:28:09
Piyush Agarwal
Classification.

00:27:28:09 - 00:27:32:22
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. Those are models. There's like tasks right. There are the two common types of yeah.

00:27:32:22 - 00:27:38:12
Nikhil Maddirala
and then there's generation. But that's a new thing. We'll talk about that later. But yes. So you can even think about

00:27:38:12 - 00:27:45:05
Nikhil Maddirala
we talked about ads. Right. So maybe before we get into neural networks, let's think about how this can become even more sophisticated.

00:27:45:05 - 00:27:48:16
Nikhil Maddirala
So what are you trying to do in ads?

00:27:48:16 - 00:28:00:20
Nikhil Maddirala
personalization. I, I'm trying to predict for you for a given ad. Are you going to buy this product or not? Right. Or maybe that's too complex. Buy or not buy, let's say. Or you're going to click on this ad, right? Right.

00:28:00:20 - 00:28:02:24
Piyush Agarwal
Right. Pretty. There's something called predictive CTR.

00:28:03:01 - 00:28:19:28
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. Predicted click through rate. So what I'm doing is I it's exactly similar to this. no I don't have a slide on that. But I have a training data set that has a bunch of clicks, and I have a bunch of characteristics of users. So I'm like,

00:28:19:28 - 00:28:23:19
Nikhil Maddirala
there's a large data set, and I know the label.

00:28:23:19 - 00:28:33:01
Nikhil Maddirala
In this case, the label is like the price. In that case, the label would be click or not click. It's a classification problem. And then I have a bunch of input features like maybe

00:28:33:01 - 00:28:42:13
Nikhil Maddirala
there's profile information like person's demographic and demographic information. You. Yeah. Yeah. Mostly it's behavioral information like about what activities they did in the past.

00:28:42:15 - 00:28:43:15
Nikhil Maddirala
And so I.

00:28:43:15 - 00:28:47:15
Piyush Agarwal
Mean, I can already think of like there would be so many parameters that one could gather.

00:28:47:15 - 00:28:53:11
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes, exactly. Those are already huge. They have several parameters. And what you're trying to do is figure out,

00:28:53:11 - 00:29:00:01
Nikhil Maddirala
optimize those parameters to get to a prediction of whether you're going to click on it or right to optimize for that. Right.

00:29:00:01 - 00:29:11:07
Nikhil Maddirala
that objective function. Right. So most actually tasks that are used in businesses today are just based on like what I would say is classical ML has nothing to do with like generative AI or any of the new stuff.

00:29:11:07 - 00:29:17:18
Nikhil Maddirala
So like ad predictions like recommender systems is trying to, which is very similar to the ads use case.

00:29:17:18 - 00:29:22:28
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I know, I mean, I spent the last seven years of my professional career. Yeah. Selling exactly that. Like,

00:29:22:28 - 00:29:26:19
Piyush Agarwal
an algorithm which can help you predict if,

you should be participating in this auction or not, because like most of Google Media sold on auction and, like, if the like, how valuable is the user and whatnot. So yeah.

00:29:34:12 - 00:29:41:08
Piyush Agarwal
Okay, so that's classical ML like the stuff that I been selling or like the technology that I primarily do.

00:29:41:08 - 00:29:49:08
Nikhil Maddirala
Well, it possibly uses neural networks, which we'll get into next week probably does or it's not clear. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

00:29:49:08 - 00:29:51:24
Nikhil Maddirala
maybe with classical ML it's already good enough.

00:29:51:24 - 00:29:52:20
Nikhil Maddirala
it depends.

00:29:52:23 - 00:29:55:08
Piyush Agarwal
Right. Okay. So next. Good. Let's go beyond classical.

00:29:55:08 - 00:29:55:09
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah

00:29:55:09 - 00:29:59:01
Nikhil Maddirala
okay. So let's go to neural networks then. That's the next thing here.
