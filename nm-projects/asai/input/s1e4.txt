00:00:00:00 - 00:00:04:26
Nikhil Maddirala
This is a system called Jarvis developed by Microsoft

00:00:04:26 - 00:00:08:16
Nikhil Maddirala
it uses a centralized language model agent

00:00:08:28 - 00:00:12:07
Nikhil Maddirala
to take your question or task and to break it down into,

00:00:12:07 - 00:00:12:23
Nikhil Maddirala
the right,

00:00:12:23 - 00:00:16:15
Nikhil Maddirala
tools that I need to use to find to, to do those tasks.

00:00:16:15 - 00:00:17:24
Nikhil Maddirala
And then it does those tasks.

00:00:17:24 - 00:00:19:25
Nikhil Maddirala
So it's like a manager in a company.

00:00:19:25 - 00:00:25:13
Piyush Agarwal
That's exactly what I was thinking. It's a yeah this is a high level thinking, high level planning,

00:00:25:13 - 00:00:39:26
Piyush Agarwal
like this is scary and amazing stuff. Like at the same time, like usually, I don't know, maybe because you're in this world, you're a product manager working on AI from, but from my perspective, this is scary stuff, man. Like, I don't know. I don't understand how matter of factly you're saying it.

00:00:39:26 - 00:00:57:20
Speaker 1
Hey, welcome to the art and science of AI journeys. In the season one, which we recorded in May 2023 as a continuous three hour long conversation. And season two is now live. So if you're enjoying this discussion, please subscribe for new episodes every week.

00:00:57:20 - 00:00:58:14
Nikhil Maddirala
now

00:00:58:14 - 00:01:06:01
Nikhil Maddirala
what this means now, how you can use GPT to like, build applications and do cool things.

00:01:06:03 - 00:01:06:09
Nikhil Maddirala
yeah.

00:01:06:10 - 00:01:28:16
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Like very interested about. So like obviously I can I've seen ChatGPT I'm paying the $20 subscription. Honestly, I feel like $20 is too little for the value that you get on of it. I mean, we're grateful to be thinking like this, that $20, like we were blessed to be in a situation where $20 seems like nothing but you know what I mean?

00:01:28:16 - 00:01:38:02
Piyush Agarwal
I mean, like, yeah, like it's it's good value for money. Like, you have a person you can talk to who's like a very smart person who's was a great general knowledge about everything.

00:01:38:02 - 00:01:39:21
Piyush Agarwal
but what are like, like,

00:01:39:21 - 00:01:44:02
Piyush Agarwal
and the other thing I want to like, talk about is like, just the pace at which everything is going on.

00:01:44:02 - 00:01:50:11
Piyush Agarwal
It just it seems like it is insane. The progress that AI has made just over the last one year.

00:01:50:13 - 00:01:51:07
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:01:51:09 - 00:01:59:21
Piyush Agarwal
A lot of people keep saying that it's exponential and like, it's hard for humans to process exponential. But what does that mean for our future? Like how

00:01:59:21 - 00:02:20:21
Piyush Agarwal
like how how but like are we heading into like just all the technologies exist already where you can think of a world where anything you see on the screen of your phone or your laptop, you can be sure if it's generated by an algorithm or if it's real, like that's I can already see a path to that world.

00:02:20:23 - 00:02:34:11
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, like absolutely indistinguishable. Like you. Let's say see a video by a person saying something. There's no way for you to tell if this is real or not. Well, I mean, it's not even far fetched. Like, I think in a year or two years we'll have that time with. Yeah, the

00:02:34:11 - 00:02:36:15
Piyush Agarwal
hyper realistic images that you're seeing.

00:02:36:15 - 00:02:38:01
Piyush Agarwal
that's like that's one area.

00:02:38:01 - 00:02:40:27
Piyush Agarwal
But like, what are some other possibilities with this technology?

00:02:40:27 - 00:02:41:18
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. I

00:02:41:18 - 00:02:51:29
Nikhil Maddirala
wonder, cause do you mind if we, like, take a moment to just look at these last two concepts that I have on exactly how GPT is being used in applications.

00:02:51:29 - 00:02:55:05
Nikhil Maddirala
just understand that for a minute and then let's pause and come back to.

00:02:55:06 - 00:02:56:04
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, for sure.

00:02:56:06 - 00:03:08:28
Nikhil Maddirala
What are the larger implications of it? So right now we got up to chat GPT what this thing can do is have a conversation with you. You ask it a question, it answers it, and that's all it can do.

00:03:08:28 - 00:03:20:02
Nikhil Maddirala
And it's only doing that based on its training data. It doesn't have access to like, anything else. Like so ChatGPT was trained on something like 300 billion tokens from the internet.

00:03:20:05 - 00:03:22:02
Piyush Agarwal
It's 300 billion words.

00:03:22:05 - 00:03:31:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. I mean, but the tokens, it's not duplicated. Like if the word the appeared like 100 times, that's 100 tokens.

00:03:31:28 - 00:03:36:15
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. Yeah. What what has it been trained on, like the internet.

00:03:36:15 - 00:03:37:25
Nikhil Maddirala
On the internet? Yeah. I mean.

00:03:37:25 - 00:03:41:23
Piyush Agarwal
Like everything every post has been written on Reddit, every movie review on I am.

00:03:41:23 - 00:03:49:29
Nikhil Maddirala
So OpenAI does not reveal this. And this is part of the criticism of OpenAI is that they're not very open in revealing like, yeah.

00:03:50:01 - 00:03:53:18
Piyush Agarwal
I don't know. Yeah. In that sentence, OpenAI is not really.

00:03:53:18 - 00:03:54:18
Nikhil Maddirala
Talking about like,

00:03:54:18 - 00:03:59:02
Nikhil Maddirala
no one knows if this is how ChatGPT was trained. This is the best guess of like, research. Really.

00:03:59:09 - 00:03:59:15
Piyush Agarwal
Cool.

00:03:59:22 - 00:04:00:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:04:00:18 - 00:04:09:03
Piyush Agarwal
Why are they call OpenAI? I'm curious. Do you know, like, what does the open stand for? I thought it was like an open source project first. Yeah, it's it's not it's not.

00:04:09:03 - 00:04:11:28
Nikhil Maddirala
100% not open source. It's a for profit company.

00:04:11:28 - 00:04:16:19
Nikhil Maddirala
it has a complicated structure. It's started as a nonprofit.

00:04:16:19 - 00:04:27:25
Nikhil Maddirala
it actually got a lot of investment from Elon Musk and a bunch of other people. So it was a nonprofit first, and then they transition to a capped profit company.

00:04:27:27 - 00:04:28:13
Piyush Agarwal
What does that mean?

00:04:28:19 - 00:04:46:24
Nikhil Maddirala
A capped profit means that, like, they set a limit, a cap on how much profit the investors can make. It's something like ten x or 100 x I for I think it's 100 x, I don't remember, but that means if I invest a million at most, I can get back 100 million. If there are more profits beyond that, that goes back into the company.

00:04:46:25 - 00:04:47:06
Piyush Agarwal
Okay.

00:04:47:13 - 00:04:48:21
Nikhil Maddirala
So non profit, just.

00:04:48:22 - 00:04:52:01
Piyush Agarwal
Other other companies that follow that model that popular companies that you know I.

00:04:52:02 - 00:04:55:02
Nikhil Maddirala
Know I don't know that this is the first one that I know of.

00:04:55:02 - 00:05:07:21
Nikhil Maddirala
so yeah, they created this new structure called Capped Profit because they realized that like the funding they were getting through being a nonprofit was not sufficient for like, the training that they had to do on everything. And then they became capped profit. And then.

00:05:07:22 - 00:05:18:03
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, Microsoft then invested heavily in them. And Microsoft now I think owns 49% of OpenAI, and the other 51% is from the original entity.

00:05:18:03 - 00:05:19:19
Nikhil Maddirala
so it's a weird, complicated usually.

00:05:19:19 - 00:05:24:06
Piyush Agarwal
No one knows what it's been trained on. It could all be everything that's ever been produced.

00:05:24:09 - 00:05:39:23
Nikhil Maddirala
There is actually evidence that OpenAI itself doesn't know what it was trained on, because in some papers they released, like they used words like, oh, this thing was inadvertently included in the training data. And like, people were like, what is inadvertently mean here?

00:05:39:23 - 00:05:44:03
Nikhil Maddirala
so I know I think they mostly know it, but they yeah, they don't release it.

00:05:44:05 - 00:05:51:29
Nikhil Maddirala
It's it's also unclear what the legal and ethical boundaries are of what they trained it on.

00:05:51:29 - 00:06:13:20
Nikhil Maddirala
that's extremely unclear right now. For example, a lot of companies are trying to lock down access to their data recently. So Reddit was a huge source of training data for OpenAI. And recently Reddit locked that down. And they said, now it's against our terms of service for you to use Reddit data to train your,

00:06:13:20 - 00:06:14:23
Nikhil Maddirala
machine learning models.

00:06:14:23 - 00:06:21:27
Nikhil Maddirala
And instead, now they're offering a paid service where they say, oh, you can use our data to train your machine learning models, but you have.

00:06:21:27 - 00:06:36:00
Piyush Agarwal
To be done. It's done. Now, the GPT three has been like, you can't remove move. Actually, that's another question. How can you, once you have trained the algorithm and let's say there's some legal complications, say that, hey, you need to ignore all of this understanding. Will it like update its vector map?

00:06:36:05 - 00:06:44:20
Nikhil Maddirala
No, I think realistically what would happen is if that happened, they would just say, sorry, this this model is illegal. Now go train a new model. That's legal.

00:06:44:22 - 00:06:51:29
Piyush Agarwal
Right? Yeah. So but in this Reddit situation they can do that with GPT three even though it's been trained on its own technology area.

00:06:52:00 - 00:06:55:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Like, I don't know, like legally it is a gray area because,

00:06:55:23 - 00:07:04:12
Nikhil Maddirala
it's publicly available. This text that's on Reddit, like anyone on the internet can access Reddit, right? Wikipedia. StackOverflow is a big one.

00:07:04:12 - 00:07:05:10
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah.

00:07:05:13 - 00:07:20:29
Nikhil Maddirala
so all these were used as sources for training data, and then those people feel like they're not both like StackOverflow and Reddit and also the users behind those websites. Like, it's kind of unfortunate that, like, their work is now.

00:07:21:01 - 00:07:21:09
Piyush Agarwal
Being.

00:07:21:09 - 00:07:25:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Monetized. Yeah. Being monetized in a way that they're not getting anything.

00:07:25:14 - 00:07:40:16
Piyush Agarwal
I imagine this is going to increasing, becoming become a huge problem. Like, yeah, with Midjourney, for example, I'm sure Midjourney is also doing something similar like trained. Yeah. Like I think the underlying technology that powers is, is stable diffusion, which was trained on like a billion images. And and it's not for you.

00:07:40:16 - 00:07:41:27
Nikhil Maddirala
Right. Status. Oh yeah.

00:07:41:27 - 00:07:43:01
Piyush Agarwal
Those images like you like

00:07:43:01 - 00:07:48:24
Piyush Agarwal
you can like midjourney you can say photography in the style of some famous like yeah that Lebowitz. Yeah.

00:07:48:24 - 00:07:52:10
Piyush Agarwal
Something. Yeah. And I'll do that. That person is not going to get any money.

00:07:52:10 - 00:07:52:29
Piyush Agarwal
yeah. Like

00:07:52:29 - 00:07:57:27
Piyush Agarwal
like celebrity images can be generated in like celebrity voices, whatnot. Like.

00:07:58:00 - 00:08:00:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. I read recently there was an artist,

00:08:00:19 - 00:08:06:13
Nikhil Maddirala
called Grimes. I don't even know who this person is. They said that. Oh, if you want to generate AI based,

00:08:06:13 - 00:08:12:22
Nikhil Maddirala
music in my voice, go for it. And, yeah, let's share 5050 or so. I don't know what the.

00:08:12:23 - 00:08:13:13
Piyush Agarwal
Anyways, I don't want to,

00:08:13:13 - 00:08:18:05
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh, yeah. Let's finish this thing and then we'll come back to this. So the thing I was going to say is, okay.

00:08:18:08 - 00:08:18:16
Piyush Agarwal
What is.

00:08:18:16 - 00:08:36:03
Nikhil Maddirala
This? Here's an example of her. Okay. Sorry. Before we get to this, let's talk about what is the limitation here right now. What can I do with this I can this model was trained on some 300 billion tokens of text. The cut off was sometime in 2020 or 2021, I think. Oh yeah.

00:08:36:04 - 00:08:36:14
Piyush Agarwal
Because,

00:08:36:14 - 00:08:39:11
Piyush Agarwal
sometimes when I ask you the question says that I don't know anything of her.

00:08:39:11 - 00:08:40:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes, exactly.

00:08:40:16 - 00:08:43:19
Piyush Agarwal
Which is unfortunately, a lot of questions I have is like, what, more recent stuff?

00:08:43:19 - 00:09:05:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh, yeah. So that's exactly what we're going to look at. So like now all this does is it create a language model based on the training data that it had up to 2021. But now what if I want to do stuff with it with more data that I have. Like how do I do that? How do I and now everyone is that's the currently one of the hottest opportunities right now actually.

00:09:05:06 - 00:09:09:08
Piyush Agarwal
So ChatGPT does not know how popular it's got in some sense.

00:09:09:08 - 00:09:10:04
Nikhil Maddirala
No it doesn't.

00:09:10:09 - 00:09:10:29
Piyush Agarwal
This is funny.

00:09:10:29 - 00:09:14:04
Nikhil Maddirala
No, it has no idea. It doesn't even know what ChatGPT is.

00:09:14:04 - 00:09:17:24
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, exactly. The yeah, yeah. That's another interesting thing. Yeah.

00:09:17:26 - 00:09:35:25
Nikhil Maddirala
So but I think one of the biggest opportunities right now, what everyone is trying to figure out is how do I connect ChatGPT to some text that's more interesting to me than what it was trained on? Right. And it could be like my own company. I have my internal database at my company, and I want to answer questions based on that.

00:09:35:25 - 00:09:37:27
Nikhil Maddirala
Or like maybe you have your own.

00:09:37:27 - 00:09:39:08
Piyush Agarwal
Like health data. It's like your.

00:09:39:08 - 00:09:39:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Health.

00:09:39:16 - 00:09:51:10
Piyush Agarwal
Look at my Fitbit log. Yeah. Everything on structured data. Yeah. Because I have my Fitbit log for the last five years and like suggest some things that I could improve. Yeah, that maybe Fitbit cannot.

00:09:51:12 - 00:10:02:10
Nikhil Maddirala
So let's try to think of a simpler example, because Fitbit logs is not typically what I would call text data. That's like very structured data. But think about if I had like a database in my company.

00:10:02:10 - 00:10:04:23
Nikhil Maddirala
actually one example I saw recently was,

00:10:04:23 - 00:10:14:15
Nikhil Maddirala
a guy that built a ChatGPT based app that would look at the history of all Lex Fridman podcast transcripts and answer any questions based on that.

00:10:14:15 - 00:10:15:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh, that's a good one. Yeah.

00:10:15:22 - 00:10:18:11
Piyush Agarwal
The guy has like, really like academic people on his.

00:10:18:11 - 00:10:41:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, exactly. So but he has like hundreds of episodes each episode probably has like tens of thousands of words in its transcript. How would you even build a system like that could interact with that level of text and find the right? Because remember, ChatGPT has a context window limited. It's like 4000 tokens. So I can only put 4000 tokens of text into ChatGPT.

00:10:41:10 - 00:10:42:20
Piyush Agarwal
Actually, could you not?

00:10:42:20 - 00:10:51:22
Piyush Agarwal
Because I don't know much about this. Maybe it's a stupid question, but take the ChatGPT model. Retrain it again with additional data. And that additional data would be the Lex Fridman transcripts.

00:10:51:22 - 00:10:56:07
Piyush Agarwal
Is it not possible for any normal person to retrain these things.

00:10:56:10 - 00:11:06:06
Nikhil Maddirala
it is possible, but that retraining actually doesn't give it new knowledge that retraining would mostly just give it new ways of answering,

00:11:06:06 - 00:11:20:24
Nikhil Maddirala
questions, a new style. The way to give it knowledge is to connect it to an external database. Retraining would be like a prohibitively expensive process every time. So yeah, suppose it does even give it new knowledge retraining.

00:11:20:26 - 00:11:39:23
Nikhil Maddirala
It's ridiculous to say that I need to train 175 billion parameter model over and over again, every time I want it to have some new knowledge. So that's not going to scale the way to do it is you connect GPT with external knowledge databases, and that's actually one of the recent evolutions that's happened. And that I want to talk about.

00:11:39:23 - 00:11:44:16
Nikhil Maddirala
This is a graphic from one of my colleagues. Actually, his name is because he works at,

00:11:44:16 - 00:11:45:22
Nikhil Maddirala
my company. And,

00:11:45:22 - 00:11:59:03
Nikhil Maddirala
he's been writing a lot about like AI and LMS, and he created this graphic of how you would create a question answering system. So think about this like you have a question about some private document that you have.

00:11:59:08 - 00:12:07:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. So what's happening there first like let's look at this box. You have what's called a vector database. We talked about like

00:12:07:19 - 00:12:18:04
Nikhil Maddirala
words to vectors embeddings, embeddings. Yeah. That's exactly what's going on here. First, what you do is you create a vector storage of your documents. In this case I assume documents.

00:12:18:04 - 00:12:22:24
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. I've been hearing a lot about these new databases that specialize in vector. So like pinecone have you heard of things.

00:12:22:24 - 00:12:31:03
Nikhil Maddirala
So pinecone is probably the most it says here example pinecone. Yeah. So pinecone is probably the most popular vector database right now. There are a couple.

00:12:31:03 - 00:12:36:26
Piyush Agarwal
Of posts I see. So these are specialized databases instead of like relational like row wise storage. Yeah they do embedding.

00:12:37:03 - 00:12:39:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. And we talked about embeddings the.

00:12:39:22 - 00:12:41:01
Piyush Agarwal
Like the nvidias of

00:12:41:01 - 00:12:41:06
Piyush Agarwal
the

00:12:41:06 - 00:12:42:02
Piyush Agarwal
the databases.

00:12:42:07 - 00:12:44:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Nvidia is processing nuts.

00:12:44:13 - 00:12:46:28
Piyush Agarwal
In public. I want to buy the stock. Yeah.

00:12:47:02 - 00:12:50:07
Nikhil Maddirala
pinecone recently announced Andreessen Horowitz invested,

00:12:50:07 - 00:12:52:26
Nikhil Maddirala
$1 billion or something in. Yeah. Good for them. It was huge.

00:12:52:26 - 00:12:54:11
Piyush Agarwal
And anyway, it's gone. So this box.

00:12:54:11 - 00:13:12:12
Nikhil Maddirala
So first, what you do is you take your entire knowledge base, all your documents. In this case, it could be your personal notes or a company's database. And you convert them to embeddings. OpenAI has an embeddings API and you upload them all to a vector database. Okay. So that's the external knowledge base that you have now. Right.

00:13:12:15 - 00:13:25:19
Piyush Agarwal
And when you so so so I keep interrupting you. But I just want to clarify. So the advantage of doing this is you've translated into a language that these models can understand with your embeddings. So the language that these new models understand are embeddings.

00:13:25:19 - 00:13:27:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes. Okay. And also

00:13:27:15 - 00:13:36:06
Nikhil Maddirala
embeddings can have mathematical operations on them to understand similarity. Yeah. And also the storage is more optimized okay.

00:13:36:08 - 00:13:36:14
Piyush Agarwal
It's

00:13:36:14 - 00:13:38:09
Piyush Agarwal
because it's designed to store embeddings.

00:13:38:09 - 00:14:01:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. Exactly. So when you ask a question like blah blah blah whatever. Like say suppose this is the Lex Friedman example, right? Suppose these documents are all Lex Friedman podcast transcripts. Suppose your question is like, hey, what did Lex say to David Deutsch or something? Right about physics, right? Right. So then the question gets converted to an embedding, right?

00:14:01:13 - 00:14:12:19
Nikhil Maddirala
And then you go and query the vector database and you find what are all you do, a vector similarity search for. What are all the documents that are similar to this query.

00:14:12:19 - 00:14:26:17
Nikhil Maddirala
So you can do vector similarity search because like vectors are mathematical objects. And you can look at what is the distance between any two vectors. So you can say given this vector, give me the ten vectors that are closest to it that are most similar to it.

00:14:26:21 - 00:14:32:02
Nikhil Maddirala
So given this question, I can ask for the ten vectors that are most similar to this.

00:14:32:02 - 00:14:34:13
Piyush Agarwal
Basically, it sounds like with this vector,

00:14:34:13 - 00:14:41:02
Piyush Agarwal
this whole vector logic you use, like with boolean, the advantage was that you've started to doing arithmetic.

00:14:41:02 - 00:14:41:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:14:41:18 - 00:14:53:18
Piyush Agarwal
On like language. Like that's what it sounds like with vector you are able to do you're able to like manipulate language without actually knowing what is in like understanding the meaning. Same. But you're able to like abstractly, manipulate it and then come up with.

00:14:53:19 - 00:15:14:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Like and originally we were talking about words as vectors. Now we have documents as vectors. Okay. So now it will retrieve the five documents that are most similar to your question. So you ask it a question. You say, tell me what Lex said to David Deutsch about like physics. Sorry, some random thing it'll look for. What are the five documents that are most similar to it?

00:15:14:28 - 00:15:42:16
Nikhil Maddirala
That's what it creates as the context. And then it passes that context to the LLM like ChatGPT. And now the question that ChatGPT just gets is like, given these five documents and this question answer the question, that's something you can directly paste into ChatGPT right now. But the thing is, if you connect it to an external knowledge base, you cannot give it the the entire transcripts would be like, you know, like thousands of pages and that can go into ChatGPT.

00:15:42:19 - 00:15:53:03
Nikhil Maddirala
So what's happening is those thousands of pages are being stored as a vector database, and you can efficiently retrieve whatever is most relevant to your question.

00:15:53:06 - 00:15:57:27
Piyush Agarwal
Why wouldn't ChatGPT just build something that makes this whole process easy? Like, yeah, they do.

00:15:57:27 - 00:16:00:14
Nikhil Maddirala
It's called ChatGPT plug ins. Oh, okay. Yeah.

00:16:00:20 - 00:16:01:28
Piyush Agarwal
So what are those like a.

00:16:02:00 - 00:16:06:16
Nikhil Maddirala
It's exactly this. Basically anyone so I can build a plug in to chat.

00:16:06:17 - 00:16:09:03
Piyush Agarwal
I don't have to like do all this vector business meaning like.

00:16:09:04 - 00:16:12:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh no you have to as the plug in developer if you want some

00:16:12:13 - 00:16:14:05
Nikhil Maddirala
so the user doesn't have.

00:16:14:05 - 00:16:30:28
Piyush Agarwal
To. Yeah. Let's say I'm a user. Yeah, a person. And I want to connect ChatGPT to like my own private data. Yeah. Where is your not forget database. Because database itself is something technical. Yeah. Like I have a I don't know like my grandfather has a bunch of like,

00:16:30:28 - 00:16:35:09
Piyush Agarwal
like a has a diary that he's been writing in for the last 50 years.

00:16:35:09 - 00:16:39:07
Piyush Agarwal
Let's. Yeah, it's in digital format. Yeah, it's in a word, doc. Yeah.

00:16:39:07 - 00:16:43:23
Piyush Agarwal
I don't want it to be released anywhere. Yeah, but I want, like, attributes. Smarts.

00:16:44:00 - 00:16:44:12
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:16:44:12 - 00:16:52:15
Piyush Agarwal
To be able to tell me stuff from that diary. Yeah. So how can I do this as a layperson who doesn't understand vector business? Like, I don't want to use the word vector. How can I achieve that?

00:16:52:23 - 00:17:13:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, you can, but the app developer. So if you're the diaries that are stored as Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft can release an ChatGPT based application that does this for you. And it says, hey, all you got to do is like, click this button to connect your Microsoft Office account to ChatGPT and you can ask any questions of it.

00:17:13:20 - 00:17:24:13
Nikhil Maddirala
So the first step is the app developers are going to do this. So Microsoft, Google, slack, discord, WhatsApp, all these applications that have

00:17:24:13 - 00:17:33:20
Nikhil Maddirala
data in it that have documents that I have knowledge bases, they all have to think about what is their business strategy, what do they want to build. And they're probably going to build these applications.

00:17:33:26 - 00:17:43:23
Nikhil Maddirala
And you as an end user can then connect. Now depending on where your data is, if your data is in Google Docs, then you can probably connect to Google and whatever application Google built.

00:17:43:23 - 00:17:49:17
Nikhil Maddirala
we talked about notion. Notion has its own AI. So yeah, it depends on where your data is. And

00:17:49:17 - 00:17:56:04
Nikhil Maddirala
this is still territory. That's extremely unclear what the business strategy will be for these companies,

00:17:56:04 - 00:17:57:18
Nikhil Maddirala
how they will develop.

00:17:57:24 - 00:18:08:02
Nikhil Maddirala
But if you're an independent app developer, you can do this. So this API is not for users. This is for app developers, right? If you want to develop an app that users can use. So you, you,

00:18:08:02 - 00:18:17:20
Nikhil Maddirala
make this podcast right. Docents, suppose you want your users to be able to interact with this docents podcast through a natural language interface.

00:18:17:20 - 00:18:21:04
Nikhil Maddirala
You could make this app, you could upload your whole transcripts,

00:18:21:04 - 00:18:37:22
Nikhil Maddirala
to a vector database and make an application such that users can say, hey, tell me, what did Nick Hill say on docents podcast about vector databases? And they could get the answer. So yeah, this stuff is what app developers can do using GPT, right?

00:18:37:24 - 00:18:40:15
Piyush Agarwal
okay. This thing, this thing is an architecture for,

00:18:40:15 - 00:18:42:02
Piyush Agarwal
ChatGPT plugin.

00:18:42:04 - 00:18:49:22
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes. For ChatGPT plugin, or more generally for a language model to interact with an external database.

00:18:49:25 - 00:18:54:06
Piyush Agarwal
Right. So again, if I step back and then let go with, high level story.

00:18:54:08 - 00:18:55:05
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:18:55:07 - 00:18:59:01
Piyush Agarwal
Like in the evolution of AI with from classical we went to okay.

00:18:59:01 - 00:19:09:05
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. From from classical programing we went to classical machine learning. And then from there we went to neural nets. And every at every point we were hitting some walls.

00:19:09:05 - 00:19:11:03
Piyush Agarwal
and then maybe we're finding new solutions.

00:19:11:05 - 00:19:11:19
Piyush Agarwal
And,

00:19:11:19 - 00:19:19:08
Piyush Agarwal
this the it led us to generative AI, which is what has fascinated us, which is the reason why we're here. And,

00:19:19:08 - 00:19:30:27
Piyush Agarwal
ChatGPT is the start. But this is another innovation that's come on top of it, which is adding plugins and giving that language model an external source of knowledge.

00:19:30:27 - 00:19:36:04
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes, exactly. Because ChatGPT doesn't have any knowledge other than what it was trained. Right?

00:19:36:06 - 00:19:37:05
Piyush Agarwal
Right.

00:19:37:05 - 00:19:39:29
Piyush Agarwal
what are some other such innovations that are happening on?

00:19:39:29 - 00:19:45:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. So I want to talk about one last thing, which is like this is just giving it external knowledge.

00:19:45:19 - 00:19:46:14
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah.

00:19:46:17 - 00:20:06:11
Nikhil Maddirala
There's also giving it whole other external capabilities and tools, like for example, ChatGPT is a language model, but it's not good at math. It's not good at like programing, if you ask it, what is 5033 times 3044? Probably won't give you a good answer to that is not.

00:20:06:14 - 00:20:08:19
Piyush Agarwal
Because the next word prediction type.

00:20:08:19 - 00:20:09:25
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:09:25 - 00:20:21:01
Nikhil Maddirala
But ChatGPT doesn't need to answer that question. All ChatGPT needs to know is that, hey, this looks like a math problem. And to answer this question, I'm going to use a calculator.

00:20:21:01 - 00:20:30:10
Nikhil Maddirala
that's what it needs to do. And then all it needs to do is figure out what are the two numbers that I need to plug into the calculator, plug them into the calculator and get the result for you.

00:20:30:12 - 00:20:31:22
Nikhil Maddirala
So that's actually two.

00:20:31:26 - 00:20:32:25
Piyush Agarwal
I have a question there.

00:20:32:25 - 00:20:40:13
Piyush Agarwal
You said the ChatGPT. The only thing is we even though at our level it looks like it's a fascinating thinking person.

00:20:40:13 - 00:20:43:16
Piyush Agarwal
Like in reality the only thing it's doing is just predicting the next word.

00:20:43:23 - 00:20:44:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, right.

00:20:44:25 - 00:20:46:17
Piyush Agarwal
That's all it is doing. Yeah. Like in reality.

00:20:46:17 - 00:20:46:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:20:47:01 - 00:20:50:21
Piyush Agarwal
Then how is it going to do all this that you describe even that, that. Oh,

00:20:50:21 - 00:20:56:18
Piyush Agarwal
it looks like it's a math problem I like that, yeah. It seems like it's more abstract thinking. Is someone just predicting them?

00:20:56:18 - 00:21:11:24
Nikhil Maddirala
That's where language model meets prompt engineering. That's where you have to develop the right prompt to get the right response. So the right prompt here could be like, hey, what tool do you need to answer this question? Imagine if you just put that prompt, that little bit.

00:21:11:25 - 00:21:28:02
Piyush Agarwal
From how you said it, you made it sound like ChatGPT is going to figure all that out for you. So you just say, AI, what is 18,000 times 1544 and ChatGPT will figure out, okay, this sounds like it's a math question. Yeah, it's only in this math question. To solve this math question, I have to invoke a calculator.

00:21:28:02 - 00:21:28:12
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:21:28:12 - 00:21:31:29
Piyush Agarwal
So this sounds like thinking oh yeah but it's not predicting. Next word. It.

00:21:31:29 - 00:21:39:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Sure. But I'm saying this is a program that you have built where ChatGPT is the central part of the program and you.

00:21:39:06 - 00:21:39:21
Piyush Agarwal
The like.

00:21:39:21 - 00:21:40:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Program.

00:21:40:06 - 00:21:43:11
Piyush Agarwal
You're saying you're still thinking from an application developer. Yeah.

00:21:43:14 - 00:21:46:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. ChatGPT is not doing this on its own.

00:21:46:22 - 00:21:52:26
Piyush Agarwal
And you will never be able to do like thinking on its own. I'm not sure what that, but like, what I mean,

00:21:52:28 - 00:21:53:20
Nikhil Maddirala
But I am

00:21:53:20 - 00:22:09:19
Nikhil Maddirala
like OpenAI. I could easily release a new thing called agent GPT that does this. So I'm not sure why it's relevant whether ChatGPT can do this or not. Right. Let's see what. Yeah, right. Most likely that's what's going to happen. Open air is probably going to release something called agent GPT or some version of that.

00:22:09:22 - 00:22:18:04
Nikhil Maddirala
There is an actual agent that can do things that calls ChatGPT and ask it specific questions. So I would ask ChatGPT given in this.

00:22:18:07 - 00:22:24:17
Piyush Agarwal
That's a good conversation to have because I'm how would agent GPT work like do you have any insights?

00:22:24:21 - 00:22:28:14
Nikhil Maddirala
That's the last example that I have here is it's called sounds.

00:22:28:14 - 00:22:46:28
Piyush Agarwal
Like the next evolution. Right. So our story has sort of like our discussion sort of leading into like this breakthroughs and getting more powers. Yeah. Right. Like it sounds like with plugins it gets more power. But like agency, like when you say agents, you means a sense of agency. That's like, right now it's from my point of view, from a layperson's point of view.

00:22:46:28 - 00:23:06:06
Piyush Agarwal
Like the only thing differentiating a human from a like a machine is like a sense of agency. Like there's like like we're not just in a meat body, right? Like we have a sense of agency. They're like a soul that we have in our meat body, like, and then we do thing in the world, like, whereas a machine, even though, let's say someone creates like in ten years from now, like,

00:23:06:06 - 00:23:09:28
Piyush Agarwal
like using whatever new breakthroughs in biology or whatnot,

00:23:09:28 - 00:23:12:29
Piyush Agarwal
like a biological machine with, like, chat and Westworld.

00:23:12:29 - 00:23:19:28
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, like some Westworld kind of thing. Like how? Like you won't have a soul like we do and have a sense of agency. But the way you.

00:23:19:29 - 00:23:36:06
Nikhil Maddirala
I don't know if those two things are related, like having a soul and agency. I could give a program simple agency. I could just say like, if a if I give a program access to my email account and say, hey, you can write emails, that's agency, but that's not a soul.

00:23:36:06 - 00:23:38:07
Nikhil Maddirala
But it's simple forms of agency. But

00:23:38:07 - 00:23:41:08
Nikhil Maddirala
suppose I create a ChatGPT that

00:23:41:08 - 00:23:42:11
Nikhil Maddirala
connects to my Gmail.

00:23:42:11 - 00:23:54:03
Nikhil Maddirala
I say, hey, every time you get an email from people like, just take that text, maybe look up some knowledge base I have and write a response and reply to push. That would be an agent.

00:23:54:06 - 00:24:01:18
Piyush Agarwal
Maybe I'm using the word agency wrongly, but just the way you were describing the thought process earlier, like, oh, it looks like this is a math problem. Yeah,

00:24:01:18 - 00:24:05:27
Piyush Agarwal
maybe I should take like two numbers from it. And you should use a calculator like.

00:24:05:29 - 00:24:16:06
Nikhil Maddirala
But I can extend that to the same example. I can say, look, if I get an email from Piyush and he has a question, figure out how to answer that question and answer that question. Use the tools.

00:24:16:06 - 00:24:32:22
Piyush Agarwal
You know. But you're saying all this a matter of factly, like this is scary and amazing stuff. Like at the same time, like usually, I don't know, maybe because you're in this world, you're a product manager working on AI from, but from my perspective, this is scary stuff, man. Like, I don't know. I don't understand how matter of factly you're saying it.

00:24:32:24 - 00:24:35:19
Piyush Agarwal
It's like this. This is thinking like you're.

00:24:35:19 - 00:24:47:22
Nikhil Maddirala
Thinking I think so the level of scariness depends on like the level of empowerment you give it. Right? So if I'm saying I give it access to my emails and I give it access to write emails.

00:24:47:22 - 00:24:48:19
Piyush Agarwal
For me, that's what

00:24:48:19 - 00:25:05:07
Piyush Agarwal
that's where the agency comes in. Like, how do you know you'll stick to like like that's the agency. I mean, like like the way you describe it, it sounds like it's like, oh, for because it sounds like you're generalizing that agency when you say that. Okay, I'm going to give it a math problem and it's going to start thinking it sounds like it's a math problem.

00:25:05:08 - 00:25:06:22
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. And I need to do this.

00:25:06:22 - 00:25:08:14
Nikhil Maddirala
This. Yeah.

00:25:08:16 - 00:25:18:08
Piyush Agarwal
Then you're again going into like the rule based world. The rule is you can only do you can have agency as long as is a math problem, but someone's going to come and say, okay, well let's remove rules out of it.

00:25:18:11 - 00:25:23:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Well, but I'm saying you define what are the things you connected to right.

00:25:23:25 - 00:25:25:20
Piyush Agarwal
Like what are the tools. Yeah.

00:25:25:21 - 00:25:40:05
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. What are the tools it's connected to. So that's how this system actually let me go to the next slide, which is the last one which is exactly about this. This is a system called Jarvis developed by Microsoft in collaboration with,

00:25:40:09 - 00:25:42:24
Piyush Agarwal
Props to the branding team where.

00:25:42:27 - 00:25:49:12
Nikhil Maddirala
collaboration with Hugging Face, which is the biggest like open source library of like, machine learning models.

00:25:49:12 - 00:25:57:04
Nikhil Maddirala
it's called hugging GPT. What it does is it uses a centralized language model agent to find,

00:25:57:04 - 00:26:01:21
Nikhil Maddirala
to take your question or task and to break it down into, like, what are the right,

00:26:01:21 - 00:26:05:13
Nikhil Maddirala
tools that I need to use to find to, to do those tasks.

00:26:05:13 - 00:26:09:03
Nikhil Maddirala
And then it does those tasks. So, yeah, let's take a look at this.

00:26:09:06 - 00:26:11:09
Piyush Agarwal
Hugging GPT hugging.

00:26:11:11 - 00:26:16:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Because it the it's called hugging face is the company. It's an open source. Like that's a nice project that

00:26:16:26 - 00:26:32:05
Nikhil Maddirala
just has a repository of like models and there's hugging GPT. So task is can you describe what this picture this depicts on count how many objects are in the picture? Okay. That's the task that comes in. Then first thing is the language model.

00:26:32:05 - 00:26:37:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Does this look task planning. It figures out like what do I need to do to

00:26:37:06 - 00:26:57:10
Nikhil Maddirala
achieve this task? And then the second thing is it translates that into model selection. So hugging face is a library of like machine learning models. They have a model for pose detection. They have a model for like image recognition. They have a bunch of different like ML models and IT and they might even have a model or a calculator or tool inside of models.

00:26:57:10 - 00:27:05:13
Nikhil Maddirala
You can think of it as tool selection. It might have a calculator tool in there. So it goes and selects like what is the right tool I need for which.

00:27:05:15 - 00:27:08:09
Piyush Agarwal
Where does it select the tool from? From the hugging face.

00:27:08:09 - 00:27:28:13
Nikhil Maddirala
In this case, we've just connected it to this set of tools like hugging face has a list of set of tools, but if you could connect it to whatever tools you want and but you would always control what tools you give it access to, right? And if you give it a access to Gmail, you could control. Do I want to give it access to read my Gmail or also right Gmail.

00:27:28:17 - 00:27:47:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Right, right. And if you give it right access that that gives it a lot more power. So what it's doing is it's finding like a set of different tools. It's breaking down the task into C. It says in this case what this picture depicts and count how many objects. So first it's breaking down. It's like

00:27:47:01 - 00:27:51:02
Nikhil Maddirala
I can describe this herd of giraffes and zebras grazing in fields.

00:27:51:06 - 00:27:59:11
Nikhil Maddirala
So for that, it needed a model that translates text to like, captions. It figured that out, that that's the first thing I need actually.

00:27:59:17 - 00:28:14:12
Piyush Agarwal
Can you click based on all that we have discussed so far? Yeah. Can you like just based on a discussion, help me understand how that happened. How did it describe text from that image? Using all the models and the evolution of AI that we have discussed so far.

00:28:14:12 - 00:28:23:29
Nikhil Maddirala
So first it took this text that says what does this picture depict? What this picture depicts and it figure it out. What is the out of the tool.

00:28:23:29 - 00:28:28:29
Piyush Agarwal
So first it had to break down the picture into raw pixels RGB pixels. Right.

00:28:29:01 - 00:28:33:14
Nikhil Maddirala
there's first it lets you process the text first before it process the image.

00:28:33:14 - 00:28:33:24
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah.

00:28:33:24 - 00:28:57:07
Nikhil Maddirala
It processed the text and it said it needs a model that can do image description. That's the first thing that I figured out. Then I went to hugging GPT. And look, it figured out that look I need this model called image captioning. That's the model, right? Then what this model does is it takes this image and it breaks down those RGB values and it gives a caption, right.

00:28:57:08 - 00:29:08:28
Nikhil Maddirala
And the caption returned is a herd of giraffes and zebras grazing in fields. But the thing is, these are all specialized models. They're not general models. This model, all it does is it takes an image and gives.

00:29:08:28 - 00:29:09:24
Piyush Agarwal
You a quote. Right?

00:29:09:27 - 00:29:14:26
Nikhil Maddirala
But here is like the central brain or like the central.

00:29:14:26 - 00:29:28:00
Nikhil Maddirala
yeah, it's a brain of the system that's doing this coordination, that's figuring out what are the tasks that need to be done. And it's selecting what. So it's like a manager in a company. Imagine you have a company and you know like yeah.

00:29:28:06 - 00:29:34:04
Piyush Agarwal
That's exactly what I was thinking. It's a yeah this is a high level thinking, high level planning, high level thing.

00:29:34:04 - 00:29:35:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. It doesn't know complex.

00:29:35:28 - 00:29:36:19
Piyush Agarwal
Things like.

00:29:36:22 - 00:29:39:12
Nikhil Maddirala
Image captioning. It doesn't know how to do like,

00:29:39:19 - 00:30:02:24
Piyush Agarwal
All the things IT managers most do, like delegate like. Yeah. But like it's in some sense like we're as employees are all like APIs. Yeah. We're all at different level. Like. Yeah. Like the more higher level you are. Like the more complex tasks you can do. Like a CEO at his level will call an API, like his VP is like, hey, like, go make this stuff in India for me, like create iPhones in India.

00:30:02:27 - 00:30:04:10
Piyush Agarwal
That's a very complex task.

00:30:04:11 - 00:30:22:08
Nikhil Maddirala
So that's actually what this is evolving to. Now this is becoming a high level manager. And it's able to break down like the next level tasks that needs to be done. And all you need to do is connect it to the right tools or models that can do that next level breakdown of tasks that it needs to do.

00:30:22:16 - 00:30:26:17
Nikhil Maddirala
And if you connect it to this huggingface library that has all of these open source.

00:30:26:17 - 00:30:45:13
Piyush Agarwal
Machine, like you're saying, it's all matter of factly like this. Like, I think you're too close in this world, and you've been talking to a lot of people who do close in this world. I am 100% sure when you speak to most laypeople, this is insane. Like, this is going to take away everyone's job. Well, I shouldn't say hyperbolic like everyone, but you know what I mean.

00:30:45:13 - 00:30:48:10
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, this is going to a lot of. Yeah.

00:30:48:12 - 00:31:15:00
Nikhil Maddirala
It's very question. Yeah. I don't know if everyone's jobs, but I would say already right now for engineering I think is software development is pretty heavily hit where I give it a specification like write a program for me that does XYZ. It can act as like a software developing like tech lead or architect or manager, and then call the models that will develop like what are the subprograms that have to be written, write all those scripts.

00:31:15:03 - 00:31:26:15
Nikhil Maddirala
and it could increase engineering efficiency. I don't know what ratio one is to two at least, but could it go to one is 231 is to five. One is an exponential thing.

00:31:26:16 - 00:31:28:08
Piyush Agarwal
No, like we think like we humans.

00:31:28:08 - 00:31:30:28
Piyush Agarwal
like from an evolutionary point of view, we don't think,

00:31:30:28 - 00:31:36:02
Piyush Agarwal
exponentially. But like if you take the progress which is exponential in case it's. Yeah, like,

00:31:36:02 - 00:31:39:08
Piyush Agarwal
it's going to increase the order of magnitude in, in node.

00:31:39:09 - 00:32:03:18
Nikhil Maddirala
But I think this is the key like innovation. Now with ChatGPT, what people have found is that it's not the purpose of this type of like language model is not just to do question answering, but to serve as like an orchestrator of like different tools. And given a task, it can do things like break down the task into its subcomponents and have a given a set of tools.

00:32:03:18 - 00:32:27:07
Nikhil Maddirala
It can identify what are the right tools that can do this task for me. And we already have like a huge set of specialized models there. Many are open source companies, may have many closed source models. And this you can set up an orchestration framework where I can take get a task, break it down, go find the right tools to do the task, execute those, rinse and repeat.

00:32:27:07 - 00:32:46:04
Nikhil Maddirala
That's what these tools like auto, GPT and maybe AGI that they're doing right now. That's that's leading to what people are calling artificial general intelligence, which is this engine that is just like able to like generally do any task that's not like a specific or a specialized task.

00:32:46:06 - 00:32:47:09
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Like,

00:32:47:09 - 00:32:48:18
Piyush Agarwal
yeah, it's crazy. Like,

00:32:48:18 - 00:33:00:09
Piyush Agarwal
like even in our discussion, we started with the simple house prediction or determining if it's an apple or an orange and it's come to already like in 2023, but it can,

00:33:00:09 - 00:33:08:21
Piyush Agarwal
figure out and do a lot of us. So actually, the other thing I want to talk about, I remember like when we were talking on phone, you mentioned that you believe that this is the iPhone moment.

00:33:08:23 - 00:33:16:17
Piyush Agarwal
And that really stuck with me. Like, can you help me understand? What do you mean when you say the iPhone moment? And why do you believe that this is the iPhone moment?
