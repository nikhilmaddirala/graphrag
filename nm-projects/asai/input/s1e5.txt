00:00:00:00 - 00:00:05:01
Piyush Agarwal
I remember like when we were talking on phone, you mentioned that you believe that this is the iPhone moment.

00:00:05:03 - 00:00:12:16
Piyush Agarwal
And that really stuck with me. Like, can you help me understand? What do you mean when you say the iPhone moment? And why do you believe that this is the iPhone moment?

00:00:12:16 - 00:00:33:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Previously, everything was based on like desktop right applications or like often non internet based. It was like, imagine I have had to like book a hotel or like call a taxi. I had to make a phone call or go online on my computer. And with the iPhone there was a change in the way I interact with the world around me, which is through this device I have in my pocket.

00:00:33:26 - 00:00:46:04
Nikhil Maddirala
I can press a button and it enables completely new use cases like imagine I'm standing on a road and I need a taxi to come to me and pick me up and take me where I need to go. That did not.

00:00:46:04 - 00:00:47:27
Piyush Agarwal
Exist. That was really magical, right?

00:00:47:27 - 00:00:56:25
Nikhil Maddirala
You actually recommended these easy jeans to me. I'm wearing them. I love them. Like, what if that was somehow captured in a knowledge base?

00:00:56:25 - 00:01:07:15
Nikhil Maddirala
And I could just tell my AI that, hey, like, go order the jeans that Piyush told me about. That's how I want to interact with computing systems and with businesses in future.

00:01:07:15 - 00:01:25:09

00:01:25:09 - 00:01:30:10
Piyush Agarwal
I remember like when we were talking on phone, you mentioned that you believe that this is the iPhone moment.

00:01:30:12 - 00:01:38:04
Piyush Agarwal
And that really stuck with me. Like, can you help me understand? What do you mean when you say the iPhone moment? And why do you believe that this is the iPhone moment?

00:01:38:07 - 00:01:44:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh yeah. First, I just want to clarify. I didn't invent this terminology like it was the Nvidia CEO that,

00:01:44:23 - 00:01:50:21
Nikhil Maddirala
came up with this terminology. He said, we are going through an iPhone moment right now.

00:01:50:21 - 00:02:07:29
Nikhil Maddirala
and so let me say why I think he said that and why I believe in it. So what was revolutionary about 2007, the iPhone moment was that there was a shift in the fundamental interface we used to interact with businesses and services.

00:02:07:29 - 00:02:29:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Previously, everything was based on like desktop right applications or like often non internet based. It was like, imagine I have had to like book a hotel or like call a taxi. I had to make a phone call or go online on my computer. And with the iPhone there was a change in the way I interact with the world around me, which is through this device I have in my pocket.

00:02:29:10 - 00:02:41:18
Nikhil Maddirala
I can press a button and it enables completely new use cases like imagine I'm standing on a road and I need a taxi to come to me and pick me up and take me where I need to go. That did not.

00:02:41:18 - 00:02:45:06
Piyush Agarwal
Exist. That was really magical, right? Like Uber was magical. Like.

00:02:45:07 - 00:02:47:04
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. Yeah. Or like,

00:02:47:04 - 00:02:48:24
Nikhil Maddirala
Uber Eats or,

00:02:48:24 - 00:02:59:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Swiggy in India, like those kind of things where, yeah, I had such a pain. Like where in India especially like explain to someone on the phone what my address is, is like Uber.

00:02:59:16 - 00:03:17:06
Piyush Agarwal
I mean, I think I increase my lifespan because and let me explain why I say that, because one of the back when we were launched, I was in India and in Bangalore. And you know, Bangalore is infamous for its taxis system to be based on negotiations and not like a fixed price. Every place you need to go, you have to negotiate the price.

00:03:17:08 - 00:03:32:06
Piyush Agarwal
And it was just the worst thing that I had to engage in. Every morning. I'd be like, okay, how much for like that building? Because I was I live very close to my office, but still not walkable because it was very hot and whatnot. So the commute to that building and that guy would be like 100. I'm like, it's literally that building.

00:03:32:06 - 00:03:36:13
Piyush Agarwal
Like, what? This this is insane. It's like, no, that's like whatever. Like and and he was.

00:03:36:13 - 00:03:43:14
Nikhil Maddirala
Saying it wasn't you're saying is just Bangalore. Maybe it started that way, but it was Hyderabad. But I lived in Bombay and.

00:03:43:17 - 00:03:48:21
Piyush Agarwal
I'm in Bombay. Like, the one good thing about Bombay is like there's still like I mean, even before Uber, there were.

00:03:48:23 - 00:03:58:29
Nikhil Maddirala
No, actually, I'll tell you, the worst thing about Bombay is in Bangalore, it's a negotiation, right? In Bombay, it's not a negotiation. And they just say yes or no. So if I say I want to go.

00:03:58:29 - 00:04:04:03
Piyush Agarwal
Here, that's a really good point. There's another problem like the one problem is the pricing ambiguity. And I preferred.

00:04:04:03 - 00:04:12:01
Nikhil Maddirala
The negotiation because in Bombay it was like I would go to the guy, he would say no, and instead just open the conversation with like how much you want.

00:04:12:02 - 00:04:15:05
Piyush Agarwal
So so, you know, I think I get your point. Like iPhone,

00:04:15:05 - 00:04:31:28
Piyush Agarwal
the iPhone moment enabled like all these businesses to come out because everyone had access to a technology like which was in the palm of their hand. It had like mapping services and like internet, like, remember that famous thing by Steve Jobs here? Like the way he the owns the right.

00:04:31:28 - 00:04:32:22
Piyush Agarwal
It's an internet.

00:04:32:22 - 00:04:37:21
Piyush Agarwal
Music, the iPod and then there and then it. And he repeated that it was like iPod.

00:04:37:21 - 00:04:46:14
Nikhil Maddirala
a new phone and a revolutionary internet communications device. Yeah, yeah. That is one of the most amazing product launches in all of history.

00:04:46:14 - 00:04:56:11
Nikhil Maddirala
but the key point is that there was a new interface, a new way in which people were interacting with businesses. So if you were a business,

00:04:56:11 - 00:04:58:18
Nikhil Maddirala
let's say it. What say you were Amazon.

00:04:58:18 - 00:05:25:25
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. Like, originally the way in which people interacted with your business was they logged on to their laptop, they went to Amazon.com, and then they transacted with your business services. Now there's a whole new interface. I have my iPhone, and what it needed for you to do is you need to develop now an iPhone application, a mobile application, so that I can interact with it on my preferred way of interaction.

00:05:25:25 - 00:05:30:22
Nikhil Maddirala
Because now, like I no longer want to log onto my computer every time I want to order.

00:05:30:22 - 00:05:31:29
Piyush Agarwal
Or on a call. Anyone?

00:05:32:01 - 00:06:05:21
Nikhil Maddirala
Exactly. Yeah. So I think that's the key shift that happened, is there's a new method for consumers to interact with businesses and services. Right. So I think the when people say there's a new iPhone moment now, what that means is there's now yet another new way in which consumers want to be able to interact with services. So I want to be able to interact with Amazon, probably not just through the regular Amazon App UI, but I want to have some like natural language interface to interact with Amazon.

00:06:05:23 - 00:06:11:07
Nikhil Maddirala
I want to tell Amazon that, hey, like, you know, based on everything you know about me,

00:06:11:07 - 00:06:26:03
Nikhil Maddirala
based on maybe you and I had an email conversation about, like, some, you know, you we've talked about easy jeans. You actually recommended these easy jeans to me. I'm wearing them. I love them. Like, what if that was somehow captured in a knowledge base?

00:06:26:03 - 00:06:51:01
Nikhil Maddirala
And I could just tell my AI that, hey, like, go order the jeans that Piyush told me about. That's how I want to interact with computing systems and with businesses in future. I don't want to have to go to Amazon or to the Uniqlo website and figure out what is the I have to go to my email, figure out, or remember in my own memory, like what you told me, and type in the name Easy Jeans and get that.

00:06:51:03 - 00:06:53:11
Nikhil Maddirala
Now it's like I want to have,

00:06:53:11 - 00:06:57:21
Nikhil Maddirala
a connected natural language interface where I can say, look, Piyush told me about this thing.

00:06:57:22 - 00:07:10:29
Piyush Agarwal
Like, you give me like a life companion of sorts, where they're context aware about all the happenings in your life, and they can like, do stuff for you, like an assistant, maybe a word companion, maybe. Yeah, that's different.

00:07:10:29 - 00:07:17:29
Nikhil Maddirala
But I think that is going to be the new interface. Like because we talked about ChatGPT, we talked about access to knowledge basis.

00:07:17:29 - 00:07:18:21
Piyush Agarwal
Right, right.

00:07:18:21 - 00:07:44:15
Nikhil Maddirala
That's already coming. We already have so much of our knowledge stored in email. If I combine my Gmail, my WhatsApp conversation history with you. Plus, if there was some way, like my phone calls with you and these interactions could be recorded and stored like there's a such a wealth of information and if that is already made context for me to have interactions, then the interactions I'm going to have with businesses are totally different.

00:07:44:16 - 00:07:49:01
Nikhil Maddirala
I'm just going to say, okay, like go order the thing Piyush told me about and yeah.

00:07:49:03 - 00:07:53:08
Piyush Agarwal
Are there examples of any such early businesses that you know of,

00:07:53:08 - 00:07:54:18
Piyush Agarwal
that are using this,

00:07:54:18 - 00:08:00:04
Piyush Agarwal
shift in interface as you describe it or like the paradigm shift from?

00:08:00:06 - 00:08:05:06
Nikhil Maddirala
So right now, I think what people are trying to do is convert existing,

00:08:05:06 - 00:08:20:07
Nikhil Maddirala
interactions into natural language interactions. So that's what ChatGPT plugins does. So ChatGPT recently or OpenAI, about a month ago released a service called plug INS, where you as a business owner can

00:08:20:07 - 00:08:25:10
Nikhil Maddirala
provide a plug in to ChatGPT. And one of the original plug ins they came out with were,

00:08:25:10 - 00:08:27:09
Nikhil Maddirala
kayak, Expedia,

00:08:27:09 - 00:08:27:22
Nikhil Maddirala
providers.

00:08:27:22 - 00:08:33:02
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes, OpenTable. You know, the restaurant bookings, Instacart. Actually, Instacart is something

00:08:33:02 - 00:08:39:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Rukmini used recently. So we keep our shopping list in Google Keep. We have a shared Google.

00:08:39:23 - 00:08:40:26
Piyush Agarwal
We do that as well. Yeah.

00:08:40:29 - 00:09:06:25
Nikhil Maddirala
We can both add things to our shopping list. Yeah. And then literally we copy paste in that entire shopping list into ChatGPT using the Instacart plugin and said, hey, order all these items and it automatically generated a Instacart order. And in fact, it asked us for some ambiguities. It said, oh, hey, you asked for like oranges. Do you want this type of orange or this type of orange?

00:09:06:27 - 00:09:30:13
Nikhil Maddirala
And then it was like, oh, you wrote yogurt, but like, what is the quantity you wanted? Yeah, blah blah blah. And then it got that information and it immediately generated an Instacart order with everything. And then all I had to do is click like approve to buy or like cancel. And over time that could learn my preferences. Maybe it just already knows that when I write apples, that means I like Fuji apples.

00:09:30:13 - 00:09:52:18
Nikhil Maddirala
That's my favorite kind of apple. When I write yogurt, I mean like whatever XYZ yogurt it says my preferences and then my interaction with Instacart is extremely simplified. Now, I don't have to like go and select like these detailed like options. I just write a very simple like Google keep list. I say I need apples, yogurt,

00:09:52:18 - 00:09:57:06
Nikhil Maddirala
potatoes, onions, whatever and it knows exactly what I mean by all that.

00:09:57:06 - 00:09:57:22
Nikhil Maddirala
It saves me.

00:09:57:22 - 00:09:59:25
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. So what I'm hearing you say is that,

00:09:59:25 - 00:10:06:07
Piyush Agarwal
like, one of the things that's going to happen is you have the existing way of doing things, and it's going to remove that friction.

00:10:06:07 - 00:10:17:04
Piyush Agarwal
and it's going to make it more easy to do these things right. Like make it more natural language like it's like, so for example right now you have your shopping list, you go on Instacart, you do all that, that whole process, that friction removed.

00:10:17:04 - 00:10:17:27
Nikhil Maddirala
And yeah, it'll.

00:10:17:27 - 00:10:27:12
Piyush Agarwal
All be done automatically. And you can sort of rely on that, your face to take care of everything. If there's ambiguity, like figure out from your preference what kind of orange you would like and all of that.

00:10:27:14 - 00:10:38:14
Nikhil Maddirala
I think it still remains to be seen exactly how this will evolve. Like, my preference is going to be stored in Instacart, or will I have my own personal AI where I store my preferences?

00:10:38:14 - 00:10:46:29
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I'm not so much bothered about like the how the how will be committed technically, I'm like sort of envisioning what our lives will look like with this, and I can see what our lives will look like.

00:10:46:29 - 00:10:48:18
Nikhil Maddirala
It's going to. Have you seen the movie her?

00:10:48:19 - 00:10:50:02
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I love that movie. Awkwafina.

00:10:50:02 - 00:10:51:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, yeah. All right. Think like,

00:10:51:17 - 00:10:52:00
Nikhil Maddirala
it's.

00:10:52:07 - 00:11:20:20
Piyush Agarwal
Actually so it's a great segue to my next question. Like movie her is a great, great, great segue way is okay, this the way you described it is how existing businesses or existing use cases will transform. But what I'm curious to know from you is what are some new things that will emerge because of the new capabilities of these technologies, like businesses that weren't possible before or ideas that were not possible to be executed before that now can be executed because of like this powerful technology you have.

00:11:20:20 - 00:11:29:00
Piyush Agarwal
And then we discuss the evolution of this. Yeah. For technology like auto, GPT being like this, this manager that you have access. Yeah. Like, hey, do this for me.

00:11:29:00 - 00:11:29:12
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:11:29:19 - 00:11:42:16
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. Like I'm anthropomorphizing auto GPT but it's going to be like, okay, this is the hi Lotus. Here's how I'm going to plan to do this task. I'm going to break it into subtasks. Here are all the tools I need to achieve these subtasks. And it's like a genie man.

00:11:42:18 - 00:11:50:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. So I mean, this is like the billion dollar question. If I knew the answer to this, I would probably go be building this product right now and I wouldn't be.

00:11:51:02 - 00:11:56:00
Piyush Agarwal
But you were in this industry, like, do you know, like some ideas that you are building that,

00:11:56:00 - 00:11:58:27
Piyush Agarwal
use cases that have not been possible before?

00:11:58:27 - 00:12:01:21
Piyush Agarwal
types of businesses that have not been possible before?

00:12:01:23 - 00:12:12:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. To be honest, like, I think it's still very early and I cannot think of any such use cases right now that are popular. ChatGPT would be one example.

00:12:12:16 - 00:12:13:14
Piyush Agarwal
Like Midjourney is an.

00:12:13:14 - 00:12:17:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Example. Midjourney and but they're like very base level examples. They're not they.

00:12:17:20 - 00:12:18:29
Piyush Agarwal
Will enable these businesses.

00:12:19:02 - 00:12:27:02
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah they will ideally enable like in future businesses. And I've been trying to think about what are some businesses that would be enabled. But

00:12:27:02 - 00:12:27:11
Nikhil Maddirala
yeah,

00:12:27:11 - 00:12:32:00
Nikhil Maddirala
I think there is no clear answer to this. Right now. If there were

00:12:32:00 - 00:12:38:13
Nikhil Maddirala
if there just can't be at this stage because it's still like early stages, if people knew the answer already, like that would already.

00:12:38:13 - 00:12:46:08
Piyush Agarwal
Be, yeah, they're right. The other question I had related to the topic that we're discussing right now is like, we have discussed this previously,

00:12:46:08 - 00:12:50:16
Piyush Agarwal
like an idea, like one of the things that we've always talked about is like,

00:12:50:16 - 00:13:06:19
Piyush Agarwal
a life of a solopreneur, right? Like, oh, you know, Preneur is a person who, like, has a product or a company is basically able to fund their life and lifestyle with the business that they are a sole employee off, meaning, like they run the business, they're it's a single employee company.

00:13:06:19 - 00:13:16:12
Piyush Agarwal
Right. And it sounds like these technologies can really enable that vision. Right. Because you can make it easier to code. If you're thinking of an online business, you can make it easy to code like there's all these

00:13:16:12 - 00:13:22:01
Piyush Agarwal
code applications you can call all these APIs it auto GP2. You can almost use it as like a tech lead and whatnot.

00:13:22:01 - 00:13:27:05
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah that's one one. The one side of thing. The other side is it sounds like

00:13:27:05 - 00:13:30:16
Piyush Agarwal
as there's more and more development in these technologies,

00:13:30:16 - 00:13:46:06
Piyush Agarwal
like these interfaces getting more and more powerful and like these API calls are getting more powerful. So it sounds like any idea that you have will sort of be short lived or you'll always live in this existential crisis, is that some API is going to basically

00:13:46:06 - 00:13:47:08
Piyush Agarwal
generalize your problem.

00:13:47:08 - 00:13:49:05
Piyush Agarwal
Like, let me give you an example. Like,

00:13:49:05 - 00:13:56:18
Piyush Agarwal
like one of the things that I've been experimenting with with Midjourney, because I find all this stuff very fascinating is that have you heard of this thing called Dream Boot?

00:13:56:20 - 00:13:57:00
Nikhil Maddirala
no.

00:13:57:00 - 00:14:20:20
Piyush Agarwal
So so Midjourney is an application where you can basically create any image that you can imagine, and you can imagine that with the prompt you would write the prominently. Imagine. But let's say you wanted to imagine yourself in different situations, like nickel in a spacesuit or Nicole, like, I don't know, wearing whatever, like a 17th century costume. Midjourney cannot do that because it's not trained on your specific face data.

00:14:20:22 - 00:14:23:12
Piyush Agarwal
So Google came up with this, research.

00:14:23:12 - 00:14:32:23
Piyush Agarwal
and then a like a, like an open source product called Dream Boot where you train the stable diffusion model on your selfies. Or like there was this cool.

00:14:32:24 - 00:14:34:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Deep dream earlier.

00:14:34:10 - 00:14:45:03
Piyush Agarwal
Right? Yeah. Maybe there are other products similar, but the idea is, yeah, then you create your own version, right? So there are a lot of businesses that are coming up with this, like a lot of, I think you were the one who actually showed me,

00:14:45:03 - 00:14:46:12
Piyush Agarwal
you shared this. I,

00:14:46:12 - 00:14:51:28
Piyush Agarwal
this guy's Twitter stream about this business he created where he was headshots, headshots.

00:14:52:04 - 00:14:58:12
Piyush Agarwal
They did it right. I was actually very inspired by that. Like this whole thing. My wheels started running. I was thinking about solopreneurs because that guy.

00:14:58:12 - 00:14:59:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Generated headshots.

00:14:59:15 - 00:15:17:16
Piyush Agarwal
A solopreneur, right. Like, what he's doing is basically is taking people's selfies, and then he's creating a AI generated headshot, which is an amazing business. All of us are on zoom. We want like a nice professional. Yeah, it cost like 500 bucks. That guy is doing for 30 bucks and like, it's like MP3 versus V, right? MP3 gets you 95% of the quality and no one cares about that 5%.

00:15:17:19 - 00:15:23:10
Piyush Agarwal
And it's like ten like a 10th of the story. So it's a 10th of the cost. But a,

00:15:23:10 - 00:15:24:22
Piyush Agarwal
Adobe, your,

00:15:24:22 - 00:15:34:18
Piyush Agarwal
ex employer is, working on this protocol. Firefly. It was just generalizing this whole thing, like, basically you'll input a bunch of pictures. And then

00:15:34:18 - 00:15:38:13
Piyush Agarwal
you'll give a prompt like do this with this, these pictures like this.

00:15:38:15 - 00:15:44:05
Piyush Agarwal
So that kills all the ideas with this concept. Right.

00:15:44:05 - 00:16:11:21
Piyush Agarwal
and then let's generalize this. It sounds like it's like an ultimate API contest where like there's everyone's trying to build like this generalized powerful thinking thing, where you basically prompt, here's what I want and you will get that. So my question really is like, there's a dream of solopreneurs, but here's this fear that like these powerful tech companies with like their GPUs and their computational power and the direction in which they're heading is like more generalized.

00:16:11:24 - 00:16:12:08
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:16:12:14 - 00:16:15:18
Piyush Agarwal
problem solving, like, how do you think about this?

00:16:15:18 - 00:16:17:05
Piyush Agarwal
like, I mean, conflict, like,

00:16:17:05 - 00:16:33:04
Piyush Agarwal
is it is it like a futile effort to even approach this part unless you're, like, thinking of getting acquired, like build something in the short term, like. But what if you want to do, like, a meaningful pursuit where you want to dedicate the rest of your like, like I have like 25, 30 years more of more work remaining.

00:16:33:04 - 00:16:43:17
Nikhil Maddirala
So sorry. Are you saying I'm trying to understand? Are you saying that the big companies are going to take over all the popular use cases and there will be nothing left for.

00:16:43:20 - 00:16:43:27
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah,

00:16:43:27 - 00:16:54:15
Piyush Agarwal
I feel like that's fine. Where are you? Is this a right way of thinking? Like I'm I'm I'm I'm telling you what I'm thinking through, and I want to I want your opinion on this. Like, is there a right way of thinking about it is.

00:16:54:18 - 00:17:00:04
Nikhil Maddirala
I think it depends on the use case. It's very possible that, like, big companies will dominate,

00:17:00:04 - 00:17:16:29
Nikhil Maddirala
because one of the things we discussed is limitations of training data, like one of the main ways in which your model is more powerful than someone else's model is because either it has more training data or it has more compute, more compute, meaning more parameters, more

00:17:16:29 - 00:17:22:10
Nikhil Maddirala
complex model, etc. training data is increasingly getting locked down.

00:17:22:10 - 00:17:23:05
Nikhil Maddirala
I think,

00:17:23:05 - 00:17:25:29
Nikhil Maddirala
in fact, one thing about Adobe is,

00:17:25:29 - 00:17:55:27
Nikhil Maddirala
this guy that I listen to, Ben Thompson, our storyteller, right? He talks about this like he did an interview with Adobe's chief product officer, Scott Belsky. And one thing they talked about was copyright violations and image generation models. And Adobe was making Adobe is very much doubling down on their model, Firefly being like a safe alternative to Midjourney because Midjourney is not safe.

00:17:55:27 - 00:17:58:12
Piyush Agarwal
Who knows what training data has been exactly getting legal.

00:17:58:12 - 00:18:02:03
Nikhil Maddirala
Troubles? Yeah, in the sense that it's legally not safe. Like.

00:18:02:05 - 00:18:02:12
Piyush Agarwal
Right.

00:18:02:12 - 00:18:06:15
Nikhil Maddirala
But it's not clear right now whether the.

00:18:06:18 - 00:18:08:23
Piyush Agarwal
So you're saying sorry. Go ahead.

00:18:08:26 - 00:18:21:21
Nikhil Maddirala
I was saying it's not clear right now whether the legal standard should be applied at the layer of input or output. That itself is not clear. Like if I take some say, you know, Marvel. Okay. As an example,

00:18:21:21 - 00:18:26:03
Nikhil Maddirala
can I take Marvel movies and images as input to my training data?

00:18:26:03 - 00:18:32:05
Nikhil Maddirala
is that valid or not? I don't know, because current copyright law does not specify.

00:18:32:05 - 00:18:39:05
Piyush Agarwal
That our current laws are not designed to understand like this. Yes, exactly. They were written in the time where, like technology like this didn't exist.

00:18:39:05 - 00:18:48:17
Nikhil Maddirala
It's very clear that at the output layer it's prohibited. If I started outputting images of Iron Man. Yes, that is very clearly prohibited by copyright law. I cannot do that.

00:18:48:17 - 00:19:04:18
Nikhil Maddirala
That that is clear. But at the input level, it's not clear. And actually, what Ben Thompson was saying is that companies like Adobe are trying to argue for a more restrictive version of the future, where they're trying to say that, hey, your input has to be heavily restricted.

00:19:04:22 - 00:19:06:06
Nikhil Maddirala
You cannot even get it right.

00:19:06:06 - 00:19:28:09
Piyush Agarwal
Okay, help me understand this, because my knowledge may be limited because of what I understand from this, but isn't the problem with these models like the problem with internet in general? Like once they've been trained, the cat is out of the bag. Like once you've trained a model on the internet, it's dumb. Like we have sufficient data that's already been generated on the internet to, like, have these models already trained like Midjourney is there?

00:19:28:12 - 00:19:38:18
Piyush Agarwal
what are you going to do with it exists. And like, you can copy, like, okay, Midjourney is a closed source, but there are like open journey, which is an open source machine. Yeah. Like champ GPT for example. Right.

00:19:38:20 - 00:19:50:01
Nikhil Maddirala
I think the question is not about the model. The question is can you commercialize the output of the model or not? That's the main question as an output of this model. Right. I got a video or an image. But you you can I.

00:19:50:05 - 00:20:04:25
Piyush Agarwal
Said that like even OpenAI does not know what it's been trained on. It's like there's the problem of explainability. And so as you like, is there a way right now to determine from the output of a model, what training data was included in that model?

00:20:04:27 - 00:20:12:03
Nikhil Maddirala
no there's not, but I think we need to answer. Is there a legal need to even clarify that question?

00:20:12:06 - 00:20:22:15
Piyush Agarwal
But because from what I what I'm hearing you say, then based on my discussion, you're saying like one plus a possible competitive advantage you might have as a solopreneur or any business might be your training data, right?

00:20:22:18 - 00:20:33:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Like that's what companies like Adobe are trying to argue. Actually, Adobe is trying to argue that, hey, like you need to train only on legitimate data sources. You need to train on, like,

00:20:33:29 - 00:20:47:20
Nikhil Maddirala
stock images or non copyrighted images, like if you train on copyrighted images that that's not legitimate. That's in Adobe's interest to make this argument because they own a lot of like stock images that they can train on.

00:20:47:27 - 00:20:48:20
Nikhil Maddirala
And Midjourney.

00:20:48:23 - 00:20:52:00
Piyush Agarwal
I know we're talking specifically about images because of the example I use, but the.

00:20:52:00 - 00:21:02:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Same applies to text. Like if I train on text from blogs, books that are copyrighted, is that a copyright violation or not? Like no one knows.

00:21:02:16 - 00:21:20:19
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, it's just the way you describe it. Let's say it does come into fruition. It sounds like a better version of the solution will be trained on everything. A suboptimal version of the solution would be restricted in its training, and eventually I feel like our tendency would be to opt for the better solution. We'll figure out, like the laws will align to that.

00:21:20:23 - 00:21:21:24
Piyush Agarwal
Everything will align to that.

00:21:21:29 - 00:21:26:10
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, I'm not sure. Sure if the laws will align though, because right now think about

00:21:26:10 - 00:21:29:14
Nikhil Maddirala
we're did a lot of training. Data came from.

00:21:29:16 - 00:21:45:13
Piyush Agarwal
The argument you're reading is when Uber came to India in a lot of cities, they were saying, no, no, let's figure out a way to keep the taxi drivers employed. And they're trying to figure out all these ways on making Uber worse so that the taxi company stays uncompetitive. That's one way to go about it.

00:21:45:13 - 00:21:54:03
Piyush Agarwal
But eventually you realize that that's a futile effort, because if there is a possibility of something more awesome, like what tendency is to go towards that.

00:21:54:05 - 00:22:11:09
Nikhil Maddirala
But I think the analogy breaks down in this way because like Uber for its existence does not depend on taxi companies, whereas like these AI models for their very existence depend on individual like content.

00:22:11:11 - 00:22:13:06
Piyush Agarwal
That's another good topic that we can discuss.

00:22:13:06 - 00:22:13:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:22:14:01 - 00:22:33:21
Piyush Agarwal
These models right now, as I understand them, they require a huge amount of data. The humans don't. Yeah, right. Like that's the like this question is coming from like the evolution that we discussed that like once we hit a wall with our machine learning based solutions, the way we found the next breakthrough was to emulate the way humans worked.

00:22:33:21 - 00:22:44:16
Piyush Agarwal
Our human mind works. If you take that analogy further, or if you take that solution further, then, like we don't require a lot of training data like if you compress that into like BI.

00:22:44:18 - 00:22:54:00
Nikhil Maddirala
We can understand like concepts. Yeah. If you tell me a concept, I can understand it with very little data. Yeah. Whereas a model needs like tons of examples.

00:22:54:00 - 00:23:15:10
Piyush Agarwal
Right, right. So so I mean, it's not far fetched to think that the next evolution would be a massive reduction in the training data required to get the same or better output quality. It's possible. Yeah. Then then what? Like so. So my original question remains is like is this like a winner takes all type deal where it's futile for like the dream of solopreneur?

00:23:15:13 - 00:23:17:20
Piyush Agarwal
As I said, solopreneurs. Yeah, I'm not saying so.

00:23:17:20 - 00:23:31:24
Nikhil Maddirala
I think actually this is a good point to distinguish. Like what are the different we're talking about entrepreneurial opportunities in the market space. Right. Like let's define the different market segments here. So there's on the one hand,

00:23:31:24 - 00:23:42:16
Nikhil Maddirala
I think classically right now VCs and people are dividing this into 3 or 4 market segments. There's hardware. There's a base layer Nvidia right.

00:23:42:19 - 00:23:43:27
Piyush Agarwal
Google with its TPU.

00:23:43:27 - 00:23:54:25
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. They're providing the hardware layer. That's number one. Number two is foundation models. That's like the large language models. OpenAI is the main player, right now. But like Google

00:23:54:25 - 00:24:09:09
Nikhil Maddirala
meta and other companies are getting into that space. So that's two layers. The third layer is the application layer. Or like building on top of the foundation models, like you're building specific applications.

00:24:09:11 - 00:24:10:12
Nikhil Maddirala
I actually don't know if.

00:24:10:12 - 00:24:30:26
Piyush Agarwal
There's a fourth layer that's not the application layer. Yeah. I feel like the the foundational model layers are going to consume the application layer, which sucks. And the reason I worry about that, even though I'm not like a solo entrepreneur, like I don't have any product, but I've seen this happen and this has been a big complaint against big tech companies, right?

00:24:30:26 - 00:24:49:16
Piyush Agarwal
Like without getting into the specifics, a lot of times people will like develop extensions for browsers or like some apps which consume Facebook APIs or like Snapchat APIs. And then eventually what happens is Facebook just creates that product that sells, removes API access, or let's say it doesn't even but.

00:24:49:22 - 00:24:54:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Facebook is not at the model layer, right? That's the application layer.

00:24:54:27 - 00:24:57:27
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I'm saying the model itself. Yeah. Generalized so.

00:24:57:27 - 00:25:04:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Much. But it's it's fundamentally not possible unless the model can have access to Facebook or Google's data.

00:25:04:18 - 00:25:07:19
Piyush Agarwal
No, no, no. In this analogy of like the the model.

00:25:07:19 - 00:25:19:17
Piyush Agarwal
your application is some specific use case that uses the model and then enables that use case. I'm saying the model itself will become so powerful and so generalized that you don't need the application layer.

00:25:19:19 - 00:25:24:25
Nikhil Maddirala
It like you need specific data. If we talk about like not access to knowledge,

00:25:24:25 - 00:25:28:21
Nikhil Maddirala
external knowledge and data. Right. Like it needs access to me.

00:25:28:22 - 00:25:35:08
Piyush Agarwal
That's just one use case and that can be solved plug ins. Like, why would that enable any more business use cases then. Hey, like, yeah.

00:25:35:10 - 00:25:37:03
Nikhil Maddirala
The plugins question is

00:25:37:03 - 00:25:41:03
Nikhil Maddirala
more complicated. Like why would if I am saying.

00:25:41:05 - 00:25:42:13
Piyush Agarwal
You native OpenAI right now.

00:25:42:14 - 00:25:56:21
Nikhil Maddirala
I work for Facebook, right? Yeah, I work for meta. So I my company owns WhatsApp. Why would WhatsApp release a plugin for OpenAI? That doesn't make any sense. Why would Facebook want to give OpenAI access to like all WhatsApp?

00:25:56:22 - 00:26:00:07
Piyush Agarwal
Why would Facebook want to give OpenAI access to an entrepreneur? Like,

00:26:00:07 - 00:26:03:13
Piyush Agarwal
like, I mean, here we're talking about like, the business opportunities, right?

00:26:03:16 - 00:26:10:24
Nikhil Maddirala
I don't think this will ever happen. I don't think meta is ever going to, like, make a plugin for OpenAI.

00:26:10:26 - 00:26:20:22
Piyush Agarwal
I know, I understand that, but I'm saying with that same logic, it would also not open or expose the API to any solopreneur or an entrepreneur who wants to create a business.

00:26:20:26 - 00:26:31:23
Nikhil Maddirala
That already exists. There's WhatsApp for business, there's a WhatsApp business API you can use it to create like automated messaging. You can create a store like,

00:26:31:23 - 00:26:34:23
Nikhil Maddirala
you can do a lot. You can. Yeah, like WhatsApp is used to.

00:26:34:25 - 00:26:55:01
Piyush Agarwal
Let's stick with that example. Let's say this there's this API. Yeah. And I use Meadow's LM like in the future let's say. So their own chat GPT lm yeah. And I build some application. What's to stop meta from making the LMS so generalized. That eliminates the need of this particular application. That's my problem. Like what what.

00:26:55:01 - 00:26:56:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Is the particular application you have?

00:26:56:21 - 00:27:04:02
Piyush Agarwal
Whatever it is. Like I'm saying eventually the these these the prompts to ChatGPT belief will be so generalized.

00:27:04:07 - 00:27:04:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:27:04:25 - 00:27:22:25
Piyush Agarwal
That they itself will act as an everything application, but it will be multimodal. Here's the thing. Like it'll be multimodal. So your input will be multimodal, meaning it could be like text or image or whatever, and the output will be multimodal. And when you have multimodal input and multimodal output, all you need to do is just generalize the application layer.

00:27:22:25 - 00:27:28:12
Piyush Agarwal
And then with text I can say here's what I want with this input and here's the output.

00:27:28:14 - 00:27:48:10
Nikhil Maddirala
I think it will ultimately come down to like what data sources and application you can plug it into and integrate with. Like I think that will be a big differentiator. I don't think GPT will like there's OpenAI, there's Google, Microsoft, Facebook. They all control different applications. And I don't think these.

00:27:48:10 - 00:27:58:13
Piyush Agarwal
Will still be the players. I'm not saying I'm like, these will be. What I'm saying is like my original question was like, as you and I, let's say we want to explore like some business ideas or you.

00:27:58:13 - 00:28:10:06
Piyush Agarwal
And it's not just like, hey, let's create something and hope that will get acquired. Or like, or whatever, like let's create something durable, enduring, like, like, yeah, they're gonna devote the next 25 years of my life.

00:28:10:09 - 00:28:11:09
Piyush Agarwal
But like,

00:28:11:09 - 00:28:11:25
Piyush Agarwal
like

00:28:11:25 - 00:28:19:04
Piyush Agarwal
the way I'm thinking about this is eventually whatever I do will be generalized within this foundational models that are.

00:28:19:06 - 00:28:30:09
Nikhil Maddirala
But I guess, like what I'm saying is, if the thing you're doing requires access to some specific knowledge base, like that is not something that can be absorbed in a foundation.

00:28:30:10 - 00:28:34:23
Piyush Agarwal
In that case, like we talked about. No, no, no, I know what you mean. But I'm saying in that case.

00:28:34:28 - 00:28:36:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Like, where's this knowledge base?

00:28:36:26 - 00:28:54:15
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I understand, so let's, let's say I build a company that uses some special knowledge base. And I obviously want customers. Right. And my customers will actually have the special knowledge. It's not that I don't I'm saying what stops these elements to create like a general interface. Like, hey, as a customer, you going through this? Cut the middleman out.

00:28:54:15 - 00:28:56:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Oh, that is ChatGPT plug ins. Exactly.

00:28:56:25 - 00:28:58:12
Piyush Agarwal
That's what I'm saying. Like, yeah.

00:28:58:12 - 00:29:12:21
Piyush Agarwal
The way I see these things evolving, you're saying. Yeah, GDB plugins and auto gpt. I am thinking the the needs like increasingly I see the tech world going into a direction where it's cutting the middleman from everywhere, like it's famously described as,

00:29:12:21 - 00:29:16:12
Piyush Agarwal
your take rate is my opportunity. Like, what that means is,

00:29:16:12 - 00:29:18:04
Piyush Agarwal
like Amazon say that.

00:29:18:04 - 00:29:19:13
Piyush Agarwal
Hey, looks like,

00:29:19:13 - 00:29:47:14
Piyush Agarwal
hey, you were selling something. You're paying the retailers 25% margin. That take rate is my opportunity. I'll sell it for 2.5% margin. So I'm gonna, like, cut the margin by like that. My take rate by an order of magnitude. I'll just take 10% of what your existing retailers take and come to my website. So I'm saying that like if you just generalize it and like take it further, it sounds like everything's going to a direction where there'll be one prompt, multimodal prompt.

00:29:47:16 - 00:30:09:13
Piyush Agarwal
Here's what I need. Here's my data, here's the output I need. And that like the the the foundational model will do that. Like I I've been grappling with that because ever since like we've been discussing this for a while. Like we just happened to have this discussion in depth today. But I've been thinking about this for a long time and I'm like, oh, I have this fascinating like Monica had this fascinating idea is like, oh, I'm going to come up with like this,

00:30:09:13 - 00:30:11:23
Piyush Agarwal
I stylist who's going to do this?

00:30:11:23 - 00:30:29:10
Piyush Agarwal
And then I'm like, I see it working really well now, but like, I'll always be living like this existential fear that, oh, like this. Because I kind of build the foundational models that empower this business. What is to stop these foundational models, just generalize it to a point where they just consume my business.

00:30:29:12 - 00:30:55:04
Nikhil Maddirala
Because I think, like your business is based on, knowledge of your specific customers, their requirements, their workflows, which the foundational models are like. I understand language in general. Yeah. And you're trying to specify that and come up with a very specific application to a niche use case. So I yeah, I don't think that will be disrupted. What's a good analogy to this.

00:30:55:04 - 00:30:55:21
Nikhil Maddirala
Like it's like

00:30:55:21 - 00:31:02:13
Nikhil Maddirala
that's like saying like because cloud computing providers exist like application layers will become irrelevant.

00:31:02:18 - 00:31:14:27
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, it's different this time. Like I know it's you can always use that. But I think it's different because the thing that we're dealing with has an agency who has intelligence. Like you. I'm using words that you used in our discussion.

00:31:15:01 - 00:31:15:15
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:31:15:15 - 00:31:21:11
Piyush Agarwal
What's the goal of AI? Let's go back to absolute basics to delegate human intelligence to these systems.

00:31:21:11 - 00:31:21:26
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:31:21:26 - 00:31:35:13
Piyush Agarwal
What is the most evolved product that we discussed today has a sense of agency hugging GPT. Now you combine those two. Do it like there's a system that has a sense of agency, has like unparalleled human intelligence, like.

00:31:35:13 - 00:31:40:18
Nikhil Maddirala
But like the thing is, there are a bunch of models out here that is using these are kind of commoditized.

00:31:40:19 - 00:31:43:16
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Open source like these are like available open source techniques.

00:31:43:16 - 00:31:47:17
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. But like the open source versions may not be good and you need some.

00:31:47:20 - 00:31:50:17
Piyush Agarwal
It's going to design its own again. But there's.

00:31:50:17 - 00:31:52:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Proprietary data like I think.

00:31:52:29 - 00:32:05:05
Piyush Agarwal
That's the I understand that's what I'm saying. The ultimate customer would have a very simple way in submitting their proprietary data. And the model for that is plug ins. Like you explained it to me and I understood what it means. Like plugins.

00:32:05:12 - 00:32:11:01
Nikhil Maddirala
But I think different types of proprietary data need different types of plug ins. And like the type.

00:32:11:01 - 00:32:14:03
Piyush Agarwal
You generalize that even like multimodal plugins.

00:32:14:05 - 00:32:22:12
Nikhil Maddirala
I'm not sure of that. But what is the task ultimately that you want to do? Each task requires a different type of data access.

00:32:22:13 - 00:32:37:20
Piyush Agarwal
That's what I'm saying. Like stuff like aging, GPT or auto GPT comes in like I have a multimodal plugin where like I need this done. And the auto GPT will figure out like okay, I need to like let's take the basic example of mathematics and calculator.

00:32:37:23 - 00:32:38:24
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:32:38:26 - 00:32:48:22
Piyush Agarwal
I want to multiply 2000 into 1644 right. Yeah. Like I can't do this right now. Yeah. But it'll figure out that it's a mathematical problem. And here's all the tools that I need.

00:32:48:22 - 00:32:49:07
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:32:49:07 - 00:32:56:03
Piyush Agarwal
And maybe there is an opportunity to develop these sub APIs. But I'm saying like what? What is to stop it from writing those APIs? Okay. Calling more agents.

00:32:56:03 - 00:33:02:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Here's one of the ideas that I've been exploring, which is like I wanted to help people write their resumes.

00:33:02:02 - 00:33:04:23
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. So let's talk about that. Yeah. Let's say a specific example.

00:33:04:23 - 00:33:06:03
Nikhil Maddirala
Someone has a resume.

00:33:06:03 - 00:33:06:11
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah.

00:33:06:18 - 00:33:27:13
Nikhil Maddirala
And they want to improve it. And I have been thinking about like, hey, can I generate like an AI based agent that can help someone improve their resume? So how would that be generalized? Like what I want to do is take someone's resume, help them understand, like what are the weak points in their resume and help them develop that.

00:33:27:15 - 00:33:36:13
Nikhil Maddirala
And right now, like if we put it through this hugging GPT system, it might find some open source models that can do things like find

00:33:36:13 - 00:33:46:11
Nikhil Maddirala
your suitability to a particular job or like your like skills, suitability or whatever. But maybe they're better specific models to do that.

00:33:46:11 - 00:33:51:15
Nikhil Maddirala
maybe for specific domains I could have specific data that helps with that.

00:33:51:15 - 00:34:05:19
Nikhil Maddirala
Like if you are applying for resumes in product management, like maybe I have a database of product management resumes that I could use to specifically optimize that. So yeah, in that context, maybe can you help me understand like what your fear is from,

00:34:05:19 - 00:34:08:17
Nikhil Maddirala
I found it like I don't at all in this show.

00:34:08:19 - 00:34:12:21
Piyush Agarwal
Maybe not. I agree with you. In the short term, yes. But if I extrapolate,

00:34:12:21 - 00:34:31:28
Piyush Agarwal
like the advancements that are happening in this technology in exponential scale, then your business is competing with, like this, exponentially increasing intelligence and whatever you're going to bring, like fine tuning the algorithm. can you keep up with this thing that, like, has gone from,

00:34:31:28 - 00:34:37:10
Piyush Agarwal
figuring out home prices and oranges and apples to, like, like this, this thing?

00:34:37:12 - 00:34:38:08
Piyush Agarwal
So I think that's like, you're.

00:34:38:10 - 00:34:45:02
Nikhil Maddirala
Always going to be like the general version and the specific version. And I think the foundational is that is.

00:34:45:05 - 00:34:53:18
Piyush Agarwal
Can I challenge that premise? Is there always going to be. Yeah. Is there always going to be. And I know I'm not I'm, I don't know like you're most likely right.

00:34:53:18 - 00:34:55:05
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:34:55:08 - 00:35:02:28
Piyush Agarwal
I think there's a very good chance that you are right. Like I'm. Yeah. It's just I want to I actually want to prove myself wrong like this fear that I.

00:35:03:00 - 00:35:24:08
Nikhil Maddirala
I think there will always be a need to fine tuned the generic version to a specific version. Like, I don't think it's possible that you can say I've come up with the generic version of something that is like absolutely fine tuned to any specific use case, like because if I say I want to write a resume, I want to write a college application, I want to write an email to my friend.

00:35:24:15 - 00:35:27:12
Nikhil Maddirala
These are all like specific applications. So

00:35:27:12 - 00:35:30:27
Nikhil Maddirala
it's possible. What you're saying though that like maybe some general that.

00:35:30:27 - 00:35:32:28
Piyush Agarwal
It is it's a great.

00:35:33:00 - 00:35:35:08
Nikhil Maddirala
Artificial general intelligence like this.

00:35:35:10 - 00:35:43:02
Piyush Agarwal
Is and the thing is so MVP in the like the way you describe it in your product manager word like a minimum viable product already exists.

00:35:43:05 - 00:35:43:14
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:35:43:14 - 00:35:46:17
Piyush Agarwal
ChatGPT no auto good. Like this thing. Okay.

00:35:46:18 - 00:35:47:23
Nikhil Maddirala
Like this is big and.

00:35:47:23 - 00:35:50:01
Piyush Agarwal
Deep to an AGI. That's insane.

00:35:50:01 - 00:35:51:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, yeah. There was a way in.

00:35:51:07 - 00:35:55:07
Piyush Agarwal
2023. And the MVP for AGI already exists.

00:35:55:12 - 00:35:57:02
Nikhil Maddirala
And it's a Jarvis or a huggy.

00:35:57:02 - 00:36:13:06
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Like in they're naming it like Jarvis and making it sound cute like Ironman whatever. But the thing is it already exists. And so if you take that exponential scale like this thing is going to get smart. But I take your point. So you're saying one area of exploration for a lot of entrepreneurs could be like this fine tuning.

00:36:13:06 - 00:36:16:18
Piyush Agarwal
Let's define by simple word fine tuning, specific domain knowledge.

00:36:16:25 - 00:36:20:13
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, fine tuning actually has a specific meaning within,

00:36:20:13 - 00:36:29:21
Nikhil Maddirala
the language model world, so I wouldn't use that. But I would say like application to domain specific application. Yeah. Yeah.

00:36:29:24 - 00:36:31:25
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. Yeah. Let's hope that.

00:36:31:25 - 00:36:32:26
Nikhil Maddirala
That's the domain knowledge. Yeah.

00:36:32:26 - 00:36:43:00
Piyush Agarwal
Because otherwise because if and I can think of other competitive modes that you can have like this seems like a good one. I hope that remains because if that goes away.

00:36:43:01 - 00:36:49:20
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah. Knowledge of like process pain points like I don't know, the classic like entrepreneur stuff.

00:36:49:23 - 00:36:55:29
Piyush Agarwal
I'll explain. Maybe I want to explain it better. Like, what's my worry? Ever since you told me about the subscription of,

00:36:55:29 - 00:37:07:21
Piyush Agarwal
ChatGPT. Where you can use the chat GPT four model. it's it's saying I've been showing. I have not been as impressed by technology since internet. Like, I remember like, 20 years back when I first discovered internet.

00:37:07:23 - 00:37:20:25
Piyush Agarwal
That's how I felt about it. And that's like the feeling that I'm getting now. And it's super smart. And if this is in 2023, then like I like, I also start thinking about this like from my daughter's point of view, like, right. Like when she's 18,

00:37:20:25 - 00:37:24:22
Piyush Agarwal
this tech what what would be the the level at which this technology would be.

00:37:24:22 - 00:37:34:13
Piyush Agarwal
So like maybe hopefully in the next 18 years it will still be the case that fine tuning or like finding your domain knowledge and processes will still define your competitive mode.

00:37:34:13 - 00:37:42:08
Piyush Agarwal
I have a fear that it might not because you're competing with something which is exponentially increasing its intelligence. Human intelligence.

00:37:42:10 - 00:38:00:00
Nikhil Maddirala
And this is what people are saying. Like there are people that are very worried about this and they're saying, this is AGI, and this is going to put all humans out of their jobs. And we have to have universal basic income, and there's no more jobs for humans to do. Like, all of this is possible. Like, yeah, I don't know.

00:38:00:01 - 00:38:01:00
Nikhil Maddirala
I don't have a.

00:38:01:03 - 00:38:13:24
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, I think this is a very good place to end. Yeah. This question I don't know, like I think that no, this is the perfect place but we don't know. Yeah. Who knows. But as of now, in the month of April in 2023, this is where things stand.

00:38:14:01 - 00:38:15:27
Nikhil Maddirala
Is it April or May? Okay. It's.

00:38:15:27 - 00:38:23:03
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah, it's still April. We're heading towards May. Do. Thank you so much for this fascinating conversation. I am I'm so glad we did this.

00:38:23:03 - 00:38:24:11
Nikhil Maddirala
I, I really enjoyed this.

00:38:24:18 - 00:38:27:01
Piyush Agarwal
Like this is great. Like we're sitting in like,

00:38:27:01 - 00:38:28:29
Piyush Agarwal
outside in California.

00:38:28:29 - 00:38:29:10
Piyush Agarwal
and this is.

00:38:29:10 - 00:38:31:23
Nikhil Maddirala
What longest conversations I've ever had. Yeah, but it.

00:38:31:24 - 00:38:33:06
Piyush Agarwal
Was so, so much fun. And,

00:38:33:06 - 00:38:37:07
Piyush Agarwal
so glad we did it. Yeah. I hope whoever is watching, if they ever watch, enjoys this.
