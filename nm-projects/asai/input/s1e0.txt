00:00:00:00 - 00:00:15:05
Piyush Agarwal
And it's not just ChatGPT, it's like I've been playing around with Midjourney and it almost seems like magic to me. Like, like when I, when I talk to ChatGPT, the way I think about this is it's as if I've talking to the smartest person I've ever talked to in my life.

00:00:15:15 - 00:00:26:10
Piyush Agarwal
I've been playing around with Midjourney. I'll give it prompts and it comes up with such fascinating images. So to me just seems like magic. Like, this is magic. Like, I, I don't think I have been this,

00:00:26:10 - 00:00:34:12
Piyush Agarwal
excited about any new technology. Like I remember, like the only time I was this fascinated by technology is when I first discovered the internet is like, whoa.

00:00:34:15 - 00:00:38:27
Piyush Agarwal
I could just, like, log into and, like, get access to anything under the earth. So

00:00:38:27 - 00:00:54:16
Piyush Agarwal
I really like the magic part, but I want to understand, like, the trick behind the magic. So can you, like, play the magician who spoils the strict for me? Like, can you give me a look under the hood? What? My goal from this is like in our conversation, I want to really, really, really understand how this technology works.

00:00:54:16 - 00:00:54:22
Piyush Agarwal
And I

00:00:54:22 - 00:01:12:16
Speaker 1
Hey, welcome to the art and science of AI journeys. In the season one, which we recorded in May 2023 as a continuous three hour long conversation. And season two is now live. So if you're enjoying this discussion, please subscribe for new episodes every week.

00:01:12:16 - 00:01:13:08
Piyush Agarwal
Welcome Nikhil

00:01:13:08 - 00:01:14:22
Piyush Agarwal
Thank you so much for doing this.

00:01:14:22 - 00:01:16:15
Piyush Agarwal
yeah. I'm so happy that we're doing this.

00:01:16:16 - 00:01:18:00
Nikhil Maddirala
Thank you for having me. I'm super.

00:01:18:00 - 00:01:19:00
Piyush Agarwal
Excited. Yeah.

00:01:19:00 - 00:01:21:12
Piyush Agarwal
So recently

00:01:21:12 - 00:01:25:22
Piyush Agarwal
I've just been so fascinated with all of the developments that's been happening around here.

00:01:25:22 - 00:01:38:02
Piyush Agarwal
You and I have talked about a lot. I mean, for also those of us listening that you and I are good friends, like we're the best of friends. We're childhood friends. We have known each other for the longest time. I feel like we have amazing conversations.

00:01:38:02 - 00:01:44:13
Piyush Agarwal
so I invited you because you know this technology pretty well. And the main goal is I just want to understand how it all works.

00:01:44:13 - 00:01:54:18
Piyush Agarwal
and the simple idea is I've been playing around with ChatGPT like, almost everyone is around me, like this technology, which is sort of blown up around us.

00:01:54:21 - 00:02:14:27
Piyush Agarwal
And it's not just ChatGPT, it's like I've been playing around with Midjourney and it almost seems like magic to me. Like, like when I, when I talk to ChatGPT, the way I think about this is it's as if I've talking to the smartest person I've ever talked to in my life. Like, ChatGPT knows everything about everything, and it's about to give me advice.

00:02:14:27 - 00:02:35:14
Piyush Agarwal
And a lot of things like, for example, is probably not a good place to be seeking such advice. But I was like, oh, my baby girl has turned six months old. I want to start feeding her solid food soon. Can you help me think through? Like, what are some considerations like the idea is I do a lot of these things, like, can you help me think through and like come up with really good answers and get me started?

00:02:35:16 - 00:02:36:06
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:02:36:09 - 00:02:47:04
Piyush Agarwal
I've been playing around with Midjourney. I'll give it prompts and it comes up with such fascinating images. So to me just seems like magic. Like, this is magic. Like, I, I don't think I have been this,

00:02:47:04 - 00:02:55:06
Piyush Agarwal
excited about any new technology. Like I remember, like the only time I was this fascinated by technology is when I first discovered the internet is like, whoa.

00:02:55:09 - 00:02:59:21
Piyush Agarwal
I could just, like, log into and, like, get access to anything under the earth. So

00:02:59:21 - 00:03:15:10
Piyush Agarwal
I really like the magic part, but I want to understand, like, the trick behind the magic. So can you, like, play the magician who spoils the strict for me? Like, can you give me a look under the hood? What? My goal from this is like in our conversation, I want to really, really, really understand how this technology works.

00:03:15:10 - 00:03:18:14
Piyush Agarwal
And I know, like, it's it might be hard to do it in a conversation, but

00:03:18:14 - 00:03:28:15
Piyush Agarwal
like, even if I can understand like at a fundamental level, like what empowers all of these technologies, I'll be like a good win for me out of this conversation. Like, that'd be good.

00:03:28:15 - 00:03:28:26
Piyush Agarwal
yeah.

00:03:28:27 - 00:03:31:12
Nikhil Maddirala
So I think what I was hoping to cover is,

00:03:31:12 - 00:03:37:14
Nikhil Maddirala
ChatGPT is super exciting right now. There's a lot of possibility with ChatGPT and,

00:03:37:14 - 00:03:52:24
Nikhil Maddirala
language model powered applications, but maybe we can take a step back and think about some of the fundamental building blocks of AI and machine learning, and that's something I can help with. And we can go deep into how does machine learning work, what are models, how are they trained?

00:03:52:26 - 00:04:05:16
Nikhil Maddirala
And then probably we won't be able to get into how is ChatGPT trained? Maybe at a high level we can look at that, but we can build up some of the foundation of what models are, how they're trained, and build some intuition behind how,

00:04:05:16 - 00:04:07:11
Nikhil Maddirala
a system like ChatGPT works.

00:04:07:11 - 00:04:24:01
Piyush Agarwal
That's that's amazing. That's actually the perfect reason why you're here is because I don't even know what I don't know. So, like, I want to learn how it works. But all of the things that you describe models, how they're training. Like, I want to understand the basics of like what is a model even like, what does it mean to train a model?

00:04:24:03 - 00:04:45:01
Piyush Agarwal
Right. And because I don't know what I don't know, I don't know what are the things that I need to know. So you actually, I think put it right. I want to understand the fundamental building blocks of this technology that ultimately power something like ChatGPT. And maybe if I understand the fundamentals, I'll be able to appreciate this technology and also see, like, what are the other possibilities with this technology?

00:04:45:08 - 00:04:54:29
Piyush Agarwal
What are some of its limitations? So yeah, like without much further ado, like why don't you take it away and help me understand, like the building blocks of,

00:04:54:29 - 00:04:57:24
Piyush Agarwal
eventually what leads up to something like a ChatGPT?

00:04:57:26 - 00:05:14:29
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah, sure. So I think the I prepared, like, a couple of topics that I want to cover, and let's keep it interactive. Like whenever we go through a topic, keep asking me questions about it. I'll maybe give a brief introduction to what this topic is, and you can keep asking me questions and we'll have an interactive back and forth.

00:05:14:29 - 00:05:19:07
Nikhil Maddirala
But what I was planning to cover is basically what is artificial intelligence. Yeah.

00:05:19:07 - 00:05:26:26
Nikhil Maddirala
what is machine learning, which is a specific subset of artificial intelligence. And then another subset of that is,

00:05:26:26 - 00:05:33:19
Nikhil Maddirala
deep learning and neural networks. And we'll cover those in some detail and then look at some applications of those which is,

00:05:33:19 - 00:05:35:24
Nikhil Maddirala
language models is one of the applications.

00:05:35:24 - 00:05:50:18
Piyush Agarwal
Can I make a request before we jump into it? Can you maybe just for the audience? I obviously know all this. It might be a bit weird for you just to give a small introduction like about like like how is it that you've come to, like, understand this technology? Like like myself. Yeah, like a little bit of a background.

00:05:50:18 - 00:05:52:23
Piyush Agarwal
You. And I'll tell you the reason why I've invited you.

00:05:52:23 - 00:05:53:04
Nikhil Maddirala
Yeah.

00:05:53:08 - 00:06:13:21
Piyush Agarwal
The reason why I do this podcast. Monica, let me start with that. First is because Monica is my favorite person to have a conversation with in this world. So I was like, hey, why don't we recorded like, we have so much fun? And I think that that's what I like about you. Like, I also really like conversing with you, like we've been conversing for the last more than ten years, I feel, and it's always been great conversations.

00:06:13:21 - 00:06:14:24
Nikhil Maddirala
20 probably.

00:06:14:24 - 00:06:18:04
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Actually. Decades. Yeah.

00:06:18:04 - 00:06:36:27
Piyush Agarwal
And you. So it's one I really enjoy having conversation with you in two. I think you're like one of the smartest persons I know. Like, I really think you're really, really smart. And, like, specifically, what I really like is one thing I have noticed is you. You really, when you understand something well, you have a really good way of explaining things.

00:06:36:27 - 00:06:40:24
Piyush Agarwal
And I think you explain things simply. And I think that's a really good,

00:06:40:24 - 00:06:54:23
Piyush Agarwal
a test to see if someone understand something. Well, because in the past, also like whenever there's been some complicated stuff, I've seen your advice and you've done a really good job in explaining that to me, simply. So like, that's why I invited you as a special guest on this podcast.

00:06:54:23 - 00:06:57:16
Piyush Agarwal
So why don't you start with a little bit about your background in.

00:06:57:19 - 00:07:04:12
Nikhil Maddirala
Okay. Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm honored. This is a lot of hype, so I hope I can live up to some of this expectation at least.

00:07:04:12 - 00:07:14:14
Nikhil Maddirala
so yeah, we know each other. And I was just thinking we met back in 2001. That's when I moved back to India. I was in the US and I joined high school in Hyderabad.

00:07:14:14 - 00:07:17:15
Nikhil Maddirala
So now it's been 22 years.

00:07:17:22 - 00:07:18:13
Piyush Agarwal
You're my oldest.

00:07:18:13 - 00:07:20:16
Nikhil Maddirala
Friend. Yeah, a lot more than ten years.

00:07:20:16 - 00:07:22:01
Nikhil Maddirala
yeah. Anyway, since then,

00:07:22:01 - 00:07:24:27
Nikhil Maddirala
so we went to high school together, and then after that, I went off,

00:07:24:27 - 00:07:30:16
Nikhil Maddirala
to the US, and I studied philosophy, and I specialized in an area of philosophy called logic.

00:07:30:16 - 00:07:37:02
Nikhil Maddirala
then I went on to get a master's degree in logic. And we'll talk a little bit about logic and how that's actually on the foundations of AI.

00:07:37:02 - 00:07:40:22
Nikhil Maddirala
So that's how I originally got interested in this field.

00:07:40:22 - 00:07:42:04
Nikhil Maddirala
and then after that,

00:07:42:04 - 00:07:49:13
Nikhil Maddirala
I originally I wanted to go deeper into that and get into academia, but I left that and joined the business world instead.

00:07:49:13 - 00:07:59:24
Nikhil Maddirala
and then I went to business school more recently and started taking some courses in computer science and machine learning. I was at Yale for business school,

00:07:59:24 - 00:08:06:29
Nikhil Maddirala
about five years or so ago, and that kind of reignited my interest in the modern methods of AI, which is machine learning.

00:08:06:29 - 00:08:17:22
Nikhil Maddirala
And this was the time when Gpt2 had just come out. So I was taking a course in machine learning at Yale in, specifically language models. And that was just when GPT two had come out.

00:08:17:22 - 00:08:23:18
Piyush Agarwal
And it was, that's so I gonna to do at some point I would want to get into like, what the hell is GPT two? Yeah, absolutely. Sorry. But yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

00:08:23:20 - 00:08:42:03
Nikhil Maddirala
So it was just a watershed moment in I was like one of the most powerful, like, models that we've ever seen. And that kind of ignited my interest to go and work in this field. And I decided that, hey, I want to pivot my career and work in tech and work specifically in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

00:08:42:05 - 00:08:47:07
Nikhil Maddirala
And then so since graduating from business school, I've been working in the tech industry.

00:08:47:07 - 00:08:49:10
Nikhil Maddirala
functionally, I'm a product manager.

00:08:49:10 - 00:09:01:02
Nikhil Maddirala
but in terms of, like the types of products I work with, they've always been a machine learning and AI based products. I spent about three years at Adobe working on enterprise and consumer machine learning applications.

00:09:01:02 - 00:09:03:19
Nikhil Maddirala
one of the coolest things I worked on Adobe was,

00:09:03:19 - 00:09:05:20
Nikhil Maddirala
the Adobe Acrobat mobile application.

00:09:05:24 - 00:09:21:07
Nikhil Maddirala
So, you know, reading PDFs on your mobile device is like a real pain in these. Like you have to pinch and zoom all the time. And we built this capability called liquid mode, which uses machine learning to understand the structure of the document that you're reading, and it converts it to a.

00:09:21:08 - 00:09:22:12
Piyush Agarwal
Simplified mobile view.

00:09:22:12 - 00:09:23:01
Nikhil Maddirala
Yes.

00:09:23:01 - 00:09:27:03
Nikhil Maddirala
mobile responsive HTML style documents. So you can read easily.

00:09:27:03 - 00:09:33:09
Nikhil Maddirala
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, it's actually really cool if you I mean, I'm plugging Adobe right now, I guess, but if you have to read PDFs,

00:09:33:09 - 00:09:40:02
Nikhil Maddirala
it's one of the best ways to do it on your mobile. And then about a year ago, I moved to meta, also known as Facebook,

00:09:40:02 - 00:09:41:14
Nikhil Maddirala
which is where I currently work.

00:09:41:17 - 00:09:45:07
Nikhil Maddirala
I work in the ads AI team.

00:09:45:07 - 00:09:48:07
Nikhil Maddirala
we are the team that builds the models that,

00:09:48:07 - 00:10:04:01
Nikhil Maddirala
personalize ad experiences. So the models that help understand which ads are most relevant to which users. Yeah. So that's my history with AI and machine. Oh, also like along the way, I got a part time master's in computer science when I was working at Adobe.

00:10:04:01 - 00:10:05:00
Nikhil Maddirala
And I,

00:10:05:00 - 00:10:08:22
Nikhil Maddirala
dug deeper into machine learning and AI in that time.

00:10:08:22 - 00:10:27:18
Nikhil Maddirala
and then right now, ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been really fascinated again with language models. I participated in a hackathon project at meta, where we built an application that generates short form video scripts for you. So, you know, meta. Right now it's trying to get creators on Instagram Reels.

00:10:27:21 - 00:10:36:04
Nikhil Maddirala
and because we have heavy competition from TikTok. So one of the ways we're trying to do that is we're trying to get make it easier for creators to create,

00:10:36:04 - 00:10:37:21
Nikhil Maddirala
short form videos on Instagram.

00:10:37:23 - 00:10:39:25
Piyush Agarwal
So what is that hackathon?

00:10:39:28 - 00:10:43:10
Nikhil Maddirala
A hackathon is a common thing that happens at tech companies,

00:10:43:10 - 00:10:48:20
Nikhil Maddirala
also at universities where basically you in a very short condensed period of time, like,

00:10:48:20 - 00:11:00:14
Nikhil Maddirala
anywhere between two days and one week, you make a small team and just build something is don't think too much about what it is you're building. Don't do a lot of detailed products, spec and, you know, get leadership approval and all.

00:11:00:15 - 00:11:03:09
Nikhil Maddirala
It's just a way for you to get your creative energy out there.

00:11:03:09 - 00:11:05:28
Piyush Agarwal
And anyone could be in a team. You don't have to have people from

00:11:05:28 - 00:11:06:02
Piyush Agarwal
team.

00:11:06:02 - 00:11:24:27
Nikhil Maddirala
Anyone can be in it. And companies encourage that. So you can take two days off of your like, current day to day job responsibilities and go part two. It's a way for companies to generate innovation and new ideas. And so I was able to do something new. I'm a product manager in my day job, but I was doing prompt engineering for this hackathon and I was writing code.

00:11:24:29 - 00:11:29:08
Nikhil Maddirala
so yeah, and also at universities, it's a way for students to get,

00:11:29:08 - 00:11:34:29
Nikhil Maddirala
exposure to building applications and actually doing things rather than just like theoretical learning.

00:11:35:01 - 00:11:56:16
Piyush Agarwal
So it looks like I picked the right person for the job to explain to me. Oh, I know the other, other reason why I'm so motivated to do this is like, I've had a decently successful sales career, and one of the things that has been like a core tenet is I like I also sell technology like I work for Google, I sell Google ads, and I feel like anything that you have to sell, you have to profoundly understand what that thing is.

00:11:56:19 - 00:12:03:20
Piyush Agarwal
And ads. You work in the ad space now and you would appreciate how complex this world is. And it's think I have a decent understanding. But,

00:12:03:20 - 00:12:13:03
Piyush Agarwal
I just feel like with this, the more I try to understand it, like more new things keep coming up and I just can't seem to keep up. So based on what you've explained, I feel like I pick the right guy for the job.

00:12:13:03 - 00:12:14:03
Piyush Agarwal
And. Yeah, let's,

00:12:14:03 - 00:12:16:23
Piyush Agarwal
Okay. Yeah, I dive into this.

00:12:16:25 - 00:12:20:27
Nikhil Maddirala
so, yeah, I made some notes here. I might refer to them every now and then.

00:12:20:27 - 00:12:21:27
Nikhil Maddirala
so do you want to get started?

00:12:21:27 - 00:12:22:24
Piyush Agarwal
Yeah. Let's do it.
